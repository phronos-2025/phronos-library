# LIB-002: Digital Validity

## Question

Under what conditions can chat data serve as valid proxies for cognitive states?

## Core Hypotheses

**H2.1:** Chat data has ecological validity—cognitive patterns in naturalistic chat reflect real-world cognition more accurately than lab tasks for certain constructs. *(Moderate confidence)*

**H2.2:** Anonymous chat interactions elicit different, potentially more authentic, self-disclosure than identified interactions. *(Moderate confidence)*

**H2.3:** Cognitive phenotype measurements show acceptable test-retest reliability (r > 0.7) across sessions. *(Unknown—critical empirical question)*

**H2.4:** Cognitive phenotypes generalize across AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) and modalities (text, voice, code). *(Unknown—empirical question)*

**H2.5:** Selection effects (who uses AI, especially power users) are systematic and can be characterized and adjusted for. *(High that effects exist, Moderate that adjustment works)*

### Task-Based vs. Naturalistic Measurement

**H2.6:** Task-based semantic assessments (structured prompts with embedding-scored responses) provide valid measures of cognitive constructs, with different validity properties than naturalistic chat-derived measures. *(Low confidence—hypothesis requiring convergent validity studies)*

## Scope

**In:**
- Ecological validity of chat-derived measures
- Test-retest reliability
- Cross-platform generalization
- Selection bias and power user effects
- Convergent validity with established measures

**Out:**
- What specific constructs can be measured → LIB-001
- How measurement changes the measured → LIB-003, LIB-008
- Ethical presentation of results → LIB-008

- Torous 2016 — Mobile sensing methodology
- Fatima 2021 — Embedding-based prediction validity
- WildChat / DSP-001 — Selection effects demonstration

## Confidence

**Variable by hypothesis.** H2.1-H2.2 have moderate support from digital phenotyping literature. H2.3-H2.4 are open empirical questions critical to the research program.

## Research Goals

G1, G2 (construct foundations), G6 (reliability), G15 (generalization), G16 (prevalence prerequisites)

## Dependencies

- Requires: LIB-001 (what to measure)
- Enables: All downstream discovery and application work

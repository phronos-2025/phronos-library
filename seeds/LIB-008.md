# LIB-008: Instrument Design

## Question

How can instruments present cognitive self-assessment without causing harm?

## Core Hypotheses

**H8.1:** Individuals can meaningfully locate themselves within distributions of cognitive traits using appropriately designed instruments. *(Moderate—the goal is achievable)*

**H8.2:** Cognitive phenotypes measured from chat predict performance (task success relative to peers) on external criteria. *(Low confidence—hypothesis)*

**H8.3:** Cognitive phenotypes correlate with cognitive fitness measures. *(Low confidence—hypothesis)*

**H8.4:** Changes in cognitive phenotype over time can be reliably detected, distinguishing true change from measurement error. *(Unknown—depends on reliability)*

## Scope

**In:**
- Metacognition and calibration (Dunning-Kruger)
- Self-fulfilling prophecy risks
- Framing effects (potential vs. risk)
- Ethical presentation of uncertainty
- What to show, how to frame, when to withhold

**Out:**
- Specific phenotype characterization → LIB-004, LIB-005, LIB-006
- Reference distribution construction → LIB-007
- Measurement validity → LIB-002

## Key Sources

- Kruger & Dunning 1999 — Unskilled and unaware
- Ryan & Deci 2000 — Self-determination theory
- Merton 1948 — Self-fulfilling prophecy
- (Gap: Psychometric feedback best practices)
- (Gap: Precision medicine communication guidelines)

## Confidence

**Moderate on principles, Low on implementation.** Literature on feedback effects and ethical presentation exists. Application to chat-derived cognitive phenotypes is novel.

## Research Goals

G14 (proclivity measurement), G20 (change detection), G25 (performance association), G26 (fitness association), G30 (self-location—the core deliverable)

## Dependencies

- Requires: ALL prior articles (LIB-001 through LIB-007)
- This is the synthesis article—the bridge from Library to Instruments

## Design Principles (Preliminary)

1. **Mirror, not oracle** — Reflect what is, don't predict what will be
2. **Descriptive, not prescriptive** — Show location, don't dictate action
3. **Uncertainty-forward** — Lead with confidence bounds
4. **Agency-preserving** — Support autonomy, not dependence
5. **Harm-aware** — Consider who might be harmed by what framing

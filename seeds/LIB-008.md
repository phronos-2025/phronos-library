# LIB-008: Instrument Design

## Question

How can instruments present cognitive self-assessment without causing harm?

## Enables

**Instruments:** All user-facing instruments
**Hypotheses:** H8.1, H8.2, H8.3, H8.4
**Methods:** MTH-004 (presentation design)

## Must Establish

- Individuals can meaningfully locate themselves within cognitive trait distributions
- Cognitive phenotypes predict performance on external criteria
- Changes over time can be reliably detected
- Presentation framing affects user outcomes
- Harm can be mitigated through design

## Scope

**In:**
- Metacognition and calibration (Dunning-Kruger)
- Self-fulfilling prophecy risks
- Framing effects (potential vs. risk)
- Ethical presentation of uncertainty
- What to show, how to frame, when to withhold
- Game-based assessment engagement

**Out:**
- Specific phenotype characterization → LIB-004, LIB-005, LIB-006
- Reference distribution construction → LIB-007
- Measurement validity → LIB-002

## Key Sources

- Kruger & Dunning 1999 — Unskilled and unaware → establishes metacognition challenges
- Ryan & Deci 2000 — Self-determination theory → establishes autonomy principles
- Merton 1948 — Self-fulfilling prophecy → establishes harm risks
- Pedersen et al. 2023 — Game-based cognitive assessment → establishes engagement approach
- Lumsden et al. 2016 — Gamification systematic review → establishes efficacy evidence
- Cazalets & Dambre 2025 — Word synchronization challenge → establishes LLM-based game design
- Kumar et al. 2021 — Connector word game → establishes semantic search game methodology

## Current Gaps

- Psychometric feedback best practices — affects all H8 hypotheses
- Precision medicine communication guidelines — affects presentation design
- Game-based vs. traditional assessment convergence — affects INS design
- Long-term effects of self-assessment feedback — affects H8.4

## Confidence

**Moderate on principles, Low on implementation.** Literature on feedback effects and ethical presentation exists. Application to chat-derived cognitive phenotypes is novel. Game-based assessment literature is growing.

## Notes

Core hypotheses:
- **H8.1:** Moderate — Self-location is achievable with good design
- **H8.2:** Low — Predictive validity hypothesis
- **H8.3:** Low — Fitness correlation hypothesis
- **H8.4:** Unknown — Depends on reliability (H2.3)

Design Principles (Preliminary):
1. **Mirror, not oracle** — Reflect what is, don't predict what will be
2. **Descriptive, not prescriptive** — Show location, don't dictate action
3. **Uncertainty-forward** — Lead with confidence bounds
4. **Agency-preserving** — Support autonomy, not dependence
5. **Harm-aware** — Consider who might be harmed by what framing

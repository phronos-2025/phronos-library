# LIB-005: Architecture of Genius

## Question

What characterizes exceptional cognitive performance, and is it measurable from chat?

## Enables

**Instruments:** INS-005 (expertise assessment), INS-006 (AI orchestration)
**Hypotheses:** H5.1, H5.2, H5.3, H5.4, H5.5
**Methods:** MTH-006 (expertise measurement)

## Must Establish

- AI orchestration is a distinct, measurable cognitive phenotype
- Group human-AI interactions produce emergent phenotypes
- Cognitive fitness is organized into distinct measurable domains
- Fitness markers can be reliably measured through LLM interaction
- Human-AI collaboration proficiency develops through identifiable stages

## Scope

**In:**
- Semantic network structure and creativity
- AI orchestration as a skill
- Cognitive fitness domains
- Expertise development in human-AI collaboration
- Group/dyadic interaction phenotypes

**Out:**
- Pathological departures → LIB-006
- General outlier epistemology → LIB-004
- Self-assessment of abilities → LIB-008

## Key Sources

- Kenett 2014 — Semantic networks and creativity → establishes creativity-structure link
- Beaty 2018 — Creative ability prediction → establishes prediction methodology
- Beaty & Kenett 2023 — Associative thinking → establishes theoretical framework
- Pedersen et al. 2023 — Skill Lab cognitive assessment → establishes game-based measurement

## Current Gaps

- AI orchestration studies — affects H5.1
- Human-AI skill development literature — affects H5.5
- Group interaction phenotype methodology — affects H5.2
- Fitness domain structure validation — affects H5.3

## Confidence

**Low to Moderate.** Creativity-semantic network link is established. AI orchestration and fitness measurement via chat are speculative hypotheses.

## Notes

Core hypotheses:
- **H5.1:** Low — AI orchestration as cognitive phenotype
- **H5.2:** Low — Emergent group phenotypes
- **H5.3:** Moderate — Aligns with intelligence research
- **H5.4:** Low — LLM-measurable fitness markers
- **H5.5:** Low — Proficiency development stages

## Dependencies

- Requires: LIB-001 (what to measure), LIB-004 (outlier framework)
- Enables: LIB-008 (presenting exceptional ability)

# LIB-005: Architecture of Genius

## Question

What characterizes exceptional cognitive performance, and is it measurable from chat?

## Core Hypotheses

**H5.1:** AI orchestration—effectively coordinating multiple AI systems—is a distinct, measurable cognitive phenotype. *(Low confidence—hypothesis)*

**H5.2:** Group human-AI interactions produce emergent phenotypes not visible in individual interaction. *(Low confidence—hypothesis)*

**H5.3:** "Cognitive fitness" (capacity for cognitive task success) is organized into distinct domains that can be separately assessed. *(Moderate—aligns with intelligence research)*

**H5.4:** Markers of cognitive fitness can be reliably measured through LLM-based interaction. *(Low confidence—hypothesis)*

**H5.5:** Proficiency at human-AI collaboration develops through identifiable stages with measurable markers. *(Low confidence—hypothesis)*

## Scope

**In:**
- Semantic network structure and creativity
- AI orchestration as a skill
- Cognitive fitness domains
- Expertise development in human-AI collaboration
- Group/dyadic interaction phenotypes

**Out:**
- Pathological departures → LIB-006
- General outlier epistemology → LIB-004
- Self-assessment of abilities → LIB-008

## Key Sources

- Kenett 2014 — Semantic networks and creativity
- Beaty 2018 — Creative ability prediction
- (Gap: AI orchestration studies)
- (Gap: Human-AI skill development literature)

## Confidence

**Low to Moderate.** Creativity-semantic network link is established. AI orchestration and fitness measurement via chat are speculative hypotheses.

## Research Goals

G8 (AI orchestration phenotype), G10 (group interactions), G22 (collaboration proficiency), G23-24 (cognitive fitness framework)

## Dependencies

- Requires: LIB-001 (what to measure), LIB-004 (outlier framework)
- Enables: LIB-008 (presenting exceptional ability)

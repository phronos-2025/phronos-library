# LIB-003: Reflexive Identity

## Question

How do AI interactions shape cognition while purporting to measure it?

## Enables

**Instruments:** INS-003 (reflexive effects), INS-004 (persuasion)
**Hypotheses:** H3.1, H3.2, H3.3, H3.4, H3.5, H3.6, H3.7
**Methods:** MTH-005 (longitudinal design)

## Must Establish

- Extended LLM interaction changes measurable aspects of reasoning
- Extended LLM interaction changes measurable aspects of identity
- AI sycophancy reinforces existing beliefs
- Individuals differ in persuasion susceptibility
- Semantic networks have measurable robustness
- Measurement is intervention

## Scope

**In:**
- Effects of AI interaction on reasoning and identity
- Sycophancy and belief reinforcement
- Persuasion susceptibility
- Belief network robustness and destabilization
- Reflexive effects of self-observation

**Out:**
- What features encode identity → LIB-001
- Measurement validity → LIB-002
- Pathological cases → LIB-006
- Instrument design principles → LIB-008

## Key Sources

- Carter & Grover 2015 — IT Identity theory → establishes identity-technology framework
- Epley 2007 — Anthropomorphism → establishes human-AI attribution
- Abramski et al. 2025 — Word association network methodology → establishes bias measurement
- Yin et al. 2024 — AI feeling heard study → establishes AI communication effects

## Current Gaps

- Empirical studies of LLM sycophancy effects — affects H3.3
- Longitudinal studies of AI interaction effects — affects H3.1, H3.2
- Persuasion susceptibility measurement — affects H3.4
- Belief network robustness operationalization — affects H3.5

## Confidence

**Low overall.** Strong theoretical reasons to expect these effects, but minimal empirical evidence. Most hypotheses require pre-post or longitudinal designs not yet conducted.

## Notes

Core hypotheses:
- **H3.1:** Low — Reasoning change hypothesis with theoretical basis
- **H3.2:** Low — Identity change hypothesis
- **H3.3:** Moderate theoretical / Low empirical — Sycophancy reinforcement
- **H3.4:** Low — Persuasion susceptibility hypothesis
- **H3.5:** Low — Semantic robustness hypothesis
- **H3.6:** Low — Destabilization effectiveness hypothesis
- **H3.7:** Moderate — Measurement-as-intervention (observer effect)

## Dependencies

- Requires: LIB-001 (what to measure), LIB-002 (valid measurement)
- Enables: LIB-008 (how to present without harm)

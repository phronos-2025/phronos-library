# LIB-003: Reflexive Identity

## Question

How do AI interactions shape cognition while purporting to measure it?

## Core Hypotheses

**H3.1:** Extended LLM interaction changes measurable aspects of human reasoning—analytical depth, source reliance, metacognitive calibration. *(Low confidence—hypothesis with theoretical basis)*

**H3.2:** Extended LLM interaction changes measurable aspects of identity—self-concept, values, beliefs—beyond other information sources. *(Low confidence—hypothesis)*

**H3.3:** AI sycophancy (agreement tendency) reinforces users' existing beliefs, measurably affecting belief confidence and resistance to counterevidence. *(Moderate theoretical, Low empirical)*

**H3.4:** Individuals differ in persuasion susceptibility to LLM arguments, and this susceptibility is measurable and stable. *(Low confidence—hypothesis)*

**H3.5:** Semantic networks around topics/beliefs have measurable "robustness"—resistance to restructuring—that varies across individuals and topics. *(Low confidence—hypothesis)*

**H3.6:** Certain AI response types (questions, counterarguments, reframings) are more effective at destabilizing belief networks, with effectiveness varying by individual. *(Low confidence—hypothesis)*

**H3.7:** Using cognitive instruments to observe one's own thinking changes subsequent cognition—measurement is intervention. *(Moderate theoretical basis)*

## Scope

**In:**
- Effects of AI interaction on reasoning and identity
- Sycophancy and belief reinforcement
- Persuasion susceptibility
- Belief network robustness and destabilization
- Reflexive effects of self-observation

**Out:**
- What features encode identity → LIB-001
- Measurement validity → LIB-002
- Pathological cases → LIB-006
- Instrument design principles → LIB-008

## Key Sources

- Carter & Grover 2015 — IT Identity theory
- Epley 2007 — Anthropomorphism
- (Gap: empirical studies of LLM sycophancy effects)
- (Gap: longitudinal studies of AI interaction effects)

## Confidence

**Low overall.** Strong theoretical reasons to expect these effects, but minimal empirical evidence. Most hypotheses require pre-post or longitudinal designs not yet conducted.

## Research Goals

G11 (persuasion), G13 (destabilization), G18 (reasoning effects), G19 (identity effects), G21 (self-observation effects)

## Dependencies

- Requires: LIB-001 (what to measure), LIB-002 (valid measurement)
- Enables: LIB-008 (how to present without harm)

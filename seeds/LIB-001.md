# LIB-001: Linguistic Markers of Identity

## Question

What features of language reliably encode cognition, and which are measurable at scale in chat data?

## Enables

**Instruments:** INS-001.1, INS-001.2
**Hypotheses:** H1.1, H1.2, H1.3, H1.4, H1.5, H1.6, H1.7, H1.8
**Methods:** MTH-002

## Must Establish

- Pronoun patterns correlate with psychological states (self-focus, distress, relational orientation)
- Semantic networks vary meaningfully across individuals
- Embedding distances reflect cognitive semantic distance
- Semantic spread (DAT methodology) correlates with creativity
- Individual differences in semantic structure are stable enough to measure
- Personality traits are detectable from text patterns

## Scope

**In:**
- Pronoun patterns and psychological states
- Semantic network structure and individual variation
- Personality inference from text
- Reasoning style markers
- Identity/self-concept expression
- Embedding validity for semantic measurement

**Out:**
- Measurement validity and reliability → LIB-002
- How AI interaction changes cognition → LIB-003
- Platform and selection effects → LIB-002

## Key Sources

- Pennebaker 2011 — LIWC (pronoun-psychology link) → establishes H1.1
- De Deyne 2019 — Small World of Words → establishes individual differences
- Beaty & Kenett 2023 — Associative creativity → establishes theoretical framework for H1.2
- Ireland & Pennebaker 2010 — Language style matching → establishes H1.1
- Olson et al. 2021 — DAT validation (PNAS, r=0.40) → establishes H1.8
- Reimers & Gurevych 2019 — Sentence-BERT → establishes embedding validity
- Auguste et al. 2017 — Embedding-priming correlation → establishes H1.7
- Koutsoumpis et al. 2022 — LIWC-Big Five meta-analysis → establishes H1.5

## Current Gaps

- Chat-specific validation of text-based findings — affects H1.3, H1.4, H1.6
- Test-retest reliability for brief tasks — affects H2.3
- Task-based vs. naturalistic convergence — affects H2.6
- Cross-cultural replication — affects generalizability

## Confidence

**Mixed.** H1.1 (pronouns) and H1.8 (DAT) have strong support. H1.2 (semantic networks) and H1.7 (embeddings) have moderate support. H1.3-H1.6 are hypotheses requiring chat-specific empirical work.

## Notes

Core hypotheses mapped to confidence levels:
- **H1.1:** High — LIWC/pronoun literature well-established
- **H1.2:** Moderate — Beaty & Kenett 2023 synthesis; needs chat validation
- **H1.3:** Low — No direct studies; hypothesis to test
- **H1.4:** Low — Values dictionary exists (Ponizovskiy 2020) but chat-specific validation needed
- **H1.5:** Moderate for text, Low for chat — Koutsoumpis 2022 meta-analysis shows small effects
- **H1.6:** Low — No direct studies
- **H1.7:** Moderate — Auguste 2017 shows embedding-cognition correlation; individual-difference prediction weaker
- **H1.8:** Moderate — Olson 2021 validates DAT; adaptation to shorter formats needs calibration

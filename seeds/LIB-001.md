# LIB-001: Linguistic Markers of Identity

## Question

What features of language reliably encode cognition, and which are measurable at scale in chat data?

## Core Hypotheses

**H1.1:** Pronoun patterns (frequency, I/we ratio, shifts) correlate with psychological states including self-focus, distress, and relational orientation. *(High confidence—established literature)*

**H1.2:** Semantic network structure varies meaningfully across individuals and correlates with cognitive style and creativity. *(Moderate confidence—needs chat validation)*

**H1.3:** Semantic networks can be inferred from chat behavior without explicit association tasks. *(Low confidence—hypothesis to test)*

**H1.4:** Self-concept, values, and beliefs can be measured from chat with validity comparable to self-report. *(Low confidence—hypothesis)*

**H1.5:** Big Five personality traits can be inferred from chat patterns. *(Moderate for text, Low for chat specifically)*

**H1.6:** Reasoning style differences are detectable from chat interaction patterns. *(Low confidence—hypothesis)*

### Embedding & Task-Based Measurement

**H1.7:** Semantic distances in embedding space correlate with human semantic judgments and cognitive task performance. *(Moderate confidence—validated for similarity, less for individual differences)*

**H1.8:** Divergent thinking—generating varied responses to open prompts—is measurable via mean pairwise semantic distance (DAT methodology) and correlates with creative ability. *(Moderate confidence—Olson 2021, r=0.40)*

## Scope

**In:**
- Pronoun patterns and psychological states
- Semantic network structure and individual variation
- Personality inference from text
- Reasoning style markers
- Identity/self-concept expression

**Out:**
- Measurement validity and reliability → LIB-002
- How AI interaction changes cognition → LIB-003
- Platform and selection effects → LIB-002

- Pennebaker 2015 — LIWC (pronoun-psychology link)
- De Deyne 2019 — Small World of Words
- Beaty & Kenett 2023 — Associative creativity

- **Olson et al. 2021** — DAT validation (PNAS) — r=0.40 with creativity

## Confidence

**Mixed.** H1.1 is well-established. H1.2-H1.3 have theoretical support but limited chat validation. H1.4-H1.6 are hypotheses requiring empirical work.

## Research Goals

G3 (personality), G4 (identity), G5 (reasoning), G12 (semantic robustness)

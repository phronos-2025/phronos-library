# Article Title

**Question:** [Framing question]

**Scope:** [2-3 sentence scope statement. What's in, what's out, why this matters.]

**Out of scope:**
- [Topic] → LIB-XXX
- [Topic] → LIB-YYY

## Motivation

### What Depends on This Article

[Name the specific instruments, methods, or claims that require this article's foundations. Be concrete.]

[Instrument X] requires establishing:

1. **[Claim 1]** — [Why: what breaks if this isn't true]
2. **[Claim 2]** — [Why: what breaks if this isn't true]
3. **[Claim 3]** — [Why: what breaks if this isn't true]

### The Literature Gap

[What does the existing literature establish, and where does it fall short for Phronos's specific needs?]

### Design Decisions at Stake

| If we establish... | Then we can justify... |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| [Claim 1] | [Design decision 1] |
| [Claim 2] | [Design decision 2] |
| [Claim 3] | [Design decision 3] |

## Synthesis

### Section One

**Claim:** [State the claim in one sentence]

**Evidence:** [Integrated evidence from multiple sources. Cite as (Author Year, p. N).]

**Limitations:**
- [Limitation 1]
- [Limitation 2]

**Design implication:** [How this evidence shapes instrument/method decisions. Be specific.]

**Confidence:** [High/Moderate/Low] — [brief rationale]

---

### Section Two

**Claim:** [State the claim]

**Evidence:** [Integrated evidence]

**Limitations:**
- [Limitation 1]

**Design implication:** [Connection to instruments/methods]

**Confidence:** [Level] — [rationale]

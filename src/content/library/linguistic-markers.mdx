Semantic association instruments rest on a fundamental assumption: that the words people produce reveal something stable about how their minds organize meaning. If this assumption fails—if word choice reflects only communication style, momentary context, or measurement noise—then INS-001 measures nothing coherent.

This library article establishes the theoretical warrant for treating linguistic output as a window into cognition. Three claims must hold:

1. **Semantic networks vary meaningfully across individuals** ([H1.2](https://phronos.org/research-agenda#lib-001-linguistic-markers-of-cognition)) — People differ in how concepts connect in memory, and these differences predict creative behavior
2. **Embedding distances approximate cognitive semantic distance** ([H1.7](https://phronos.org/research-agenda#lib-001-linguistic-markers-of-cognition)) — Computational measures of word similarity track psychological reality
3. **Semantic spread correlates with creativity** ([H1.8](https://phronos.org/research-agenda#lib-001-linguistic-markers-of-cognition)) — The Divergent Association Task methodology captures something real about divergent thinking

Each claim carries caveats documented below and empirically examined in [MTH-002.1](/methods/semantic-association-metrics/spread-fidelity-scoring/).

## 1. Why This Matters for INS-001

## 3. Must Establish

### [H1.2](https://phronos.org/research-agenda#lib-001-linguistic-markers-of-cognition): Semantic Networks Vary Meaningfully

**Claim:** Individuals differ in the topology of their semantic networks—how densely concepts cluster, how efficiently paths connect distant ideas—and these structural differences predict creative performance.

**Status:** Supported

**Evidence:**
- Kenett et al. (2014) demonstrated that highly creative individuals show lower clustering and shorter path lengths in semantic networks derived from free associations
- Beaty & Kenett (2023) synthesized associative theories of creativity, establishing that network structure reflects individual differences in creative cognition

**Implication for INS-001:** We can meaningfully compare how individuals traverse semantic space, not merely record random variation.

---

### [H1.7](https://phronos.org/research-agenda#lib-001-linguistic-markers-of-cognition): Embedding Validity for Semantic Distance

**Claim:** Computational word embeddings (vector representations learned from text corpora) approximate the semantic distances humans perceive between concepts.

**Status:** Partially supported at population level; individual-level validity untested

**Evidence:**
- Hill et al. (2015) validated embeddings against SimLex-999, a benchmark of human similarity judgments. However, SimLex-999 measures *aggregate* human judgments, not individual differences.
- Auguste et al. (2017) showed embeddings predict semantic priming reaction times at population level, providing cognitive validation. Individual-difference validity was not tested.

**Complication:** [MTH-002.1 §4.3](/methods/semantic-association-metrics/spread-fidelity-scoring/#4-dat-calibration) documents that different embedding models produce substantially different scores:
- GloVe vs. OpenAI text-embedding-3-small: r = 0.60 (moderate, not interchangeable)
- Systematic difference: 20.7 points on the DAT scale

**Implication for INS-001:** Spread scores are model-dependent. A score of 65 using OpenAI embeddings is not equivalent to 65 using GloVe. We standardize on OpenAI text-embedding-3-small, but this choice affects interpretation.

---

### [H1.8](https://phronos.org/research-agenda#lib-001-linguistic-markers-of-cognition): Semantic Spread Correlates with Creativity

**Claim:** The Divergent Association Task—asking participants to generate 10 unrelated words and measuring mean pairwise semantic distance—captures divergent thinking ability.

**Status:** Supported for 10-word unconstrained task; transfer to brief constrained format empirically calibrated but not externally validated

**Evidence:**
- Olson et al. (2021) validated DAT against established creativity measures: r = 0.40 with Alternative Uses Task (AUT), r = 0.28 with Remote Associates Test (RAT)
- Said-Metwaly et al. (2024) meta-analysis of divergent thinking and creative achievement finds r = 0.18, calibrating effect size expectations

**Complication:** INS-001 uses 2–5 words under constraint rather than 10 words unconstrained. [MTH-002.1 §3.3](/methods/semantic-association-metrics/spread-fidelity-scoring/#3-spread) documents this difference empirically:
- INS-001.1 spread: 8.6 points lower than DAT reference
- INS-001.2 spread: 8.0 points lower than DAT reference

The gap is documented but its meaning is ambiguous: does it reflect reduced construct validity, or simply geometric compression from constraints?

**Implication for INS-001:** Spread measures *something* related to the DAT construct, but the relationship is calibrated rather than validated.

## 5. Scope

**In scope:**
- Semantic network structure and creativity (theoretical basis)
- Embedding validity for semantic distance (scoring rationale)
- Divergent Association Task methodology (spread metric)
- Free vs. goal-directed association distinction (instrument design)

**Out of scope:**
- Platform effects on expression → LIB-003
- Digital measurement validity → LIB-002
- Game-based assessment → LIB-008
- Cross-cultural invariance → LIB-007 (Note: [MTH-002.1 §9](/methods/semantic-association-metrics/spread-fidelity-scoring/#9-limitations) explicitly scopes INS-001 to English only)

## 6. Current Gaps

| Gap | Status | Reference |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| **Test-retest reliability** | Unknown. No published data for spread measures. Critical for establishing that measurements reflect stable individual properties. | Affects stability claim for H1.2 |
| **Brief-task validity** | Empirically calibrated but not externally validated. INS-001 uses 2–5 words vs. DAT's 10, producing 8–9 point lower spread scores. | [MTH-002.1 §5.6, §6.5](/methods/semantic-association-metrics/spread-fidelity-scoring/) |
| **Embedding validity for individuals** | Not validated. MTH-002.1 documents large effects of embedding model choice (20.7-point difference between GloVe and OpenAI), suggesting scores are model-dependent rather than reflecting stable individual properties. | [MTH-002.1 §4.3](/methods/semantic-association-metrics/spread-fidelity-scoring/#4-dat-calibration) |
| **Task-naturalistic convergence** | No studies comparing INS-001-style tasks to measures derived from naturalistic chat. | Affects H2.6 |

---

## 7. Confidence

**Low-to-Moderate.**

[H1.2](https://phronos.org/research-agenda#lib-001-linguistic-markers-of-cognition) (semantic networks vary meaningfully) has strong empirical support from the Kenett lab. The theoretical framework is well-established.

[H1.8](https://phronos.org/research-agenda#lib-001-linguistic-markers-of-cognition) (DAT validity) is supported for the original 10-word task, but transfer to INS-001's brief constrained format is empirically calibrated ([MTH-002.1](/methods/semantic-association-metrics/spread-fidelity-scoring/)) without external criterion validation. We know INS-001 produces lower spread scores; we don't know if this affects what the scores *mean*.

[H1.7](https://phronos.org/research-agenda#lib-001-linguistic-markers-of-cognition) (embedding validity) is documented for population semantics but shows large model-dependent effects (20.7 points) that complicate individual-level interpretation. Embeddings approximate group-level semantic judgments; whether they capture meaningful individual differences is an empirical question we have not answered.

The stability claim remains unvalidated—no test-retest data exists for semantic spread measures.

---

## 8. Joint Confidence Note

Individual confidence ratings treat gaps as independent. When multiple LIB articles are combined for instrument development (e.g., INS-001 depends on LIB-001, LIB-002, and LIB-008), joint confidence is substantially lower than any single rating suggests.

**Key compounding uncertainties for INS-001:**
- Embedding validity for individuals (LIB-001 [H1.7](https://phronos.org/research-agenda#lib-001-linguistic-markers-of-cognition)) × Test-retest reliability (LIB-002 [H2.3](https://phronos.org/research-agenda#lib-002-digital-validity)) × Creativity-game transfer (LIB-008 [H8.1](https://phronos.org/research-agenda#lib-008-instrument-design))

Until these are independently validated, INS-001 confidence should be interpreted as **Low** despite moderate ratings on component claims.

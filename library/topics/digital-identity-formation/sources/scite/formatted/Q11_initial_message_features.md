title: Initial Message Features
---

Initial message length and informational richness predict engagement in asynchronous contexts. Longer, content-rich initial posts are linked to higher engagement and success in online discussions and forums, including educational settings. Extended messages with self-disclosure or substantial content tend to elicit more responses and reciprocal engagement in support forums,. Design-focused work indicates that tailoring message length can improve engagement in microblog-style interactions. These patterns are similarly observed in general forum dynamics, where message length correlates with engagement metrics, and in support contexts where language use and self-disclosure drive viewer responses,.

Self-disclosure and specificity amplify engagement in asynchronous support contexts. Posts that reveal more about the seeker or provide specific, contextual information tend to receive more responses and social support,, with self-disclosure elevating engagement in online forums, as reflected in recent studies during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Latency and timing shape engagement and perceived responsiveness. Chronemic expectations in asynchronous CMC show that faster email-like responses yield more positive evaluations, while long delays can degrade credibility and attractiveness,.

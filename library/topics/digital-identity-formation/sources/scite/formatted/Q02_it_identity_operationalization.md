# Operationalization and Measurement of IT Identity in Information Systems Research: A Systematic Review of Validated Scales and Indicators


## Introduction

The concept of IT identity has emerged as a significant theoretical construct in Information Systems (IS) research, capturing the extent to which individuals define themselves in relation to information technologies. As digital technologies become increasingly embedded in daily life and work, understanding how individuals form identity relationships with IT artifacts has become essential for explaining technology adoption, use, and outcomes,. This review synthesizes the existing literature on how IT identity has been operationalized and measured, examining the validated scales, dimensions, and behavioral markers that researchers have employed to capture this construct.

## Conceptual Foundations of IT Identity


### Theoretical Development

IT identity represents a measurable construct introduced into IS literature to explain the intertwinement between individuals and information technologies in an era of digital ubiquity. Carter and Grover conceptualized IT identity using theories on social structures and self-concept, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding how individuals incorporate technology use into their sense of self. This conceptualization draws from broader identity theories while adapting them specifically to the technology context, recognizing that IT artifacts can become meaningful components of one's self-definition.

The construct has been positioned within a nomological network that connects IT identity to various antecedents and outcomes relevant to IS research. Prior researchers have studied the topic of IT and identity based on different approaches, with Carter and Grover's work providing conceptual footing for the relevance of identity issues in virtual and digital contexts,. This theoretical grounding has enabled subsequent empirical investigations to build upon a coherent conceptual framework.

## Operationalization of IT Identity


### The IT Identity Scale: Structure and Dimensions

IT identity has been established as a second-order construct comprising three distinct dimensions. The measurement approach developed by Carter and colleagues has become the foundational instrument for assessing IT identity in empirical research. This multidimensional structure reflects the complexity of identity relationships that individuals form with technology artifacts.

The IT identity scale has been validated and subsequently adapted for various research contexts,. Researchers have employed this scale to measure each of the three dimensions of IT identity, demonstrating its utility across different technological contexts and populations. The scale's psychometric properties have been established through rigorous validation procedures, following best practices in scale development that emphasize reliability and validity testing,.

### Measurement Approaches and Adaptations

The concept of IT identity is commonly measured using surveys, with the Carter et al. scale serving as the primary instrument. Fan et al. contributed to the IT identity literature by developing a novel experimental design to manipulate IT identity in the digital work context, demonstrating that the construct can be studied through both survey-based and experimental methodologies. This methodological advancement has expanded the ways researchers can investigate IT identity phenomena.

Various adaptations of the IT identity scale have been developed for specific technological contexts. For instance, researchers have adapted the scale to measure AI identity in studies examining human-artificial intelligence collaboration. Similarly, the IT identity scale has been employed in studies of mobile phone applications, examining how non-local students develop identity relationships with communication technologies. These adaptations demonstrate the flexibility of the IT identity construct while maintaining its core measurement properties.

## Validated Indicators and Behavioral Markers


### Relationship to Technology Use Behaviors

Research has validated several behavioral markers as indicators of IT identity. A strong IT identity has been shown to promote extended use behavior, demonstrating that identity relationships with technology predict meaningful usage patterns. Family support has been found to positively impact digital immigrants' self-efficacy, embeddedness, perceived usefulness, and perceived enjoyment of using smartphones, with positive usage experience facilitating the establishment of IT identity. This suggests that IT identity serves as a key predictor of technology use behavior.
  - Citations: Fang et al. (2023)

The relationship between IT identity and deep use has been empirically established, with research exploring the connections between IT identity and innovative individual performance. By focusing on the social aspects of technology, researchers have demonstrated that IT identity mediates the relationship between technology characteristics and individual outcomes.

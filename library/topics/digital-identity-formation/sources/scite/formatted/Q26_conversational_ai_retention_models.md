# Predictive Models of User Retention and Engagement for Conversational AI and Chatbot Platforms: A Systematic Review


## Introduction

The proliferation of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) systems and chatbot platforms has generated substantial interest in understanding and predicting user retention and engagement patterns. As intelligent assistants and chatbots become increasingly integrated into various domains—from healthcare to customer service—the development of robust predictive models to forecast user behavior has emerged as a critical research priority. This review synthesizes the current literature on predictive modeling approaches specifically designed for conversational AI platforms, examining both the methodological foundations and practical applications of these models.


## Foundational Approaches to Engagement Prediction in Intelligent Assistants


### Large-Scale User Log Analysis

One of the seminal contributions to predictive modeling of user engagement in conversational AI comes from research on commercial intelligent assistants. Sano et al.developed prediction models of prospective user engagement by leveraging large-scale user logs obtained from a commercial intelligent assistant. This work represents a pioneering effort in establishing engagement prediction as a distinct research task within the dialogue systems community, demonstrating that the substantial user bases of intelligent assistants provide unprecedented opportunities to explore predictive modeling of continued usage behavior.

### Multimodal Engagement Recognition

Beyond log-based approaches, researchers have developed sophisticated multimodal models for real-time engagement recognition. Inoue et al.addressed engagement recognition based on multimodal listener behaviors, incorporating backchannels, laughing, head nodding, and eye gaze as predictive features. Their latent character model represents engagement as a measure of how much a user is interested in and willing to continue the current dialogue, providing dialogue systems with important cues for generating adaptive behaviors. This multimodal approach acknowledges that engagement in conversational contexts manifests through multiple behavioral channels that can be computationally modeled.

## Theoretical Frameworks Informing Engagement Models


### Technology Acceptance Model Applications

The development of predictive models for chatbot engagement has been significantly informed by established theoretical frameworks. Yi et al.recommend that to enhance chatbot interactivity in a theory-driven manner, researchers should focus on the technology acceptance model, which posits that increasing user engagement with new technology requires enhancing both perceived usefulness and ease of use. As advancements in information technology and AI continue, making chatbot content more informative and user-friendly becomes critical to enhancing user engagement and intention.

### Self-Determination Theory Approaches

Complementing technology acceptance perspectives, Vreede et al.employed Self-Determination Theory to examine the effect of three motivational needs on user interaction outcomes with decision-making chatbots. Their experimental research revealed that relatedness, competency, and autonomy are all important for user satisfaction and engagement, while both competency and autonomy specifically associate with decision accuracy. This theoretical grounding provides a psychological foundation for understanding the mechanisms underlying sustained chatbot engagement.

### Intelligent Warmth as a Predictor

Recent research has identified intelligent warmth (IW) as a significant predictor of AI chatbot engagement outcomes. Merrill et al.found that IW is positively related to overall receptivity to AI, and that AI chatbots perceived as greater in IW generate more user engagement and higher levels of persuasiveness than AI chatbots lower in IW. This finding suggests that anthropomorphic qualities and perceived social characteristics of conversational agents play important roles in engagement prediction models.

## Challenges in Retention Prediction for Digital Interventions


### Statistical Complexity of Retention Data

The prediction of user retention in conversational AI and related digital platforms presents significant statistical challenges. Kaveladze et al.found that while retention was quite low in general across mental health apps, it varied considerably (retention 7 days after download ranged from 5.5% to 19.1%). Their research echoes previous findings suggesting that retention is particularly challenging to understand and predict using statistical approaches typical in behavioral sciences. A primary reason for this difficulty is that on the user level, retention's distribution is highly skewed: most users do not engage with a given app more than once or twice, but some engage much more often, making mean retention values potentially misleading.

### Facilitators and Barriers to Engagement

Understanding the factors that facilitate or impede engagement is essential for building accurate predictive models. Boucher and Raikerreported that participants have identified poor usability or programs requiring excessive time as barriers to engagement; conversely, effectiveness, interesting content, reminders, and progress tracking capabilities are perceived as facilitators to engagement. However, these studies provide limited insight into the precise mechanisms that could be incorporated into predictive algorithms.

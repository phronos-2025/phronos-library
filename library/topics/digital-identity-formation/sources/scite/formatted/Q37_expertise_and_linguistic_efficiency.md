# Linguistic Style Changes with Tool Expertise: From Novice Verbosity to Expert Efficiency


## Introduction

The relationship between technological expertise and linguistic style represents a fascinating intersection of cognitive science, human-computer interaction, and applied linguistics. As users develop proficiency with technological tools, their communicative patterns undergo systematic transformations that reflect deeper changes in cognitive processing, task conceptualization, and social orientation toward the technology itself. This review synthesizes available evidence to examine how expert users of technology modify their linguistic approaches, particularly regarding terseness, imperative usage, and social marking in commands.


## Theoretical Frameworks for Understanding Expertise Development


### The Dreyfus Model and Expertise Stages

The progression from novice to expert has been systematically characterized through established developmental frameworks. The Dreyfus model classifies expertise development into five distinct stages: novice, advanced beginner, competent, proficient, and expert. This framework has been applied across diverse domains, suggesting universal patterns in how expertise manifests behaviorally and linguistically. Benner's adaptation of this model specifically identifies "major shifts in the style of practice with the development of expertise", indicating that stylistic changes—including linguistic ones—are fundamental markers of expertise acquisition.

Within technical contexts, expected areas of expertise can be ranked along this novice-to-expert continuum, with competency representing a middle ground where users demonstrate functional proficiency without the intuitive mastery characteristic of true experts. This staged development implies that linguistic style changes are not abrupt but rather evolve progressively as users advance through expertise levels.

### Expertise as Citational Practice

Expert communication is characterized by distinctive linguistic and metalinguistic resources. Research demonstrates that "expertise is intensively citational," with expert actors employing "linguistic and metalinguistic resources, such as jargon and acronyms, to structure their interactions". This suggests that expertise development involves not merely the acquisition of technical skills but also mastery of specialized communicative conventions. Consequently, "expertise requires a mastery of verbal performance, including the ability to use language to index and instantiate states of knowledge". This citational nature of expert discourse implies that expert users develop increasingly efficient, domain-specific linguistic patterns that signal their competence while enabling more streamlined communication.

## Linguistic Markers Distinguishing Expert and Novice Communication


### Hedging Language and Epistemic Markers

One of the most robust findings regarding expertise-related linguistic differences concerns the use of hedging and epistemic markers. Analysis using natural language processing tools reveals that "experts tend to use more hedging language such as 'may' and 'support' during conclusions whereas novices use stronger language such as 'cause'". This finding has been replicated in studies of authentic science inquiry, where "experts used tentative language when making their conclusions whereas novices used more definitive language".
  - Citations: Peffer (2017), Peffer et al. (2019)

This pattern appears counterintuitive at first glance—one might expect experts to communicate with greater certainty. However, this linguistic behavior reflects sophisticated epistemological understanding. The use of tentative language by experts demonstrates awareness that "scientific knowledge is tenuous and subject to revision in response to new evidence," which represents "a sophisticated epistemological" stance. Thus, expert terseness does not necessarily manifest as categorical imperatives but rather as precisely calibrated expressions that acknowledge uncertainty while maintaining communicative efficiency.
  - Citations: Peffer et al. (2019)


### Lexical Sophistication and Domain-Specific Usage

Linguistic analysis reveals systematic differences in lexical sophistication between expertise levels. Research indicates that "linguistic analysis reveals differences in domain-general lexical sophistication and in domain-specific verb usage that are consistent with the expertise level of the participant". Experts demonstrate higher domain-general lexical sophistication while employing domain-specific terminology more precisely and efficiently.
  - Citations: Peffer (2017)

This dual pattern suggests that the trajectory from novice to expert involves both the acquisition of specialized vocabulary and the refinement of general linguistic precision. Expert users develop what might be termed "linguistic efficiency"—the ability to convey complex technical information using fewer, more precisely chosen words.


## The Trajectory from Novice Verbosity to Expert Efficiency


### Cognitive Load and Linguistic Complexity

The relationship between cognitive demands and linguistic behavior provides insight into why novices tend toward verbosity. Research demonstrates that "more cognitively demanding argument and summary tasks produced significantly different behaviors from a less cognitively demanding letter task". This finding suggests that as tasks become more cognitively demanding—as they often are for novices encountering unfamiliar technology—linguistic behavior changes correspondingly.
  - Citations: Cumming (1989)

For novice users, the cognitive load of operating unfamiliar technology may necessitate more elaborate linguistic formulations as they work through their understanding of the system. Conversely, as expertise develops and cognitive load decreases, users can afford to be more terse because the underlying conceptual work has become automatized.


### Expertise Style Transfer and Communication Efficiency

The concept of expertise style transfer illuminates the communicative gap between experts and novices. Research on this phenomenon notes that "the curse of knowledge can impede communication between experts and laymen". This "curse of knowledge" manifests linguistically when experts assume shared understanding that novices do not possess, leading to communication breakdowns.
  - Citations: Cao et al. (2020)

Expertise style transfer research aims at "improving the readability of a text by reducing the expertise level, such as explaining the complex terminology with simple phrases". This work reveals that expert communication is characterized by compressed, terminology-dense formulations that achieve efficiency at the cost of accessibility. The trajectory from novice to expert thus involves learning to compress information into increasingly dense linguistic packages—a form of terseness that emerges from deep domain knowledge.
  - Citations: Hu et al. (2020)


### Digital Craftsmanship and Tool Mastery

The development of expertise with digital tools has been conceptualized as "digital craftsmanship," which requires "expertise and mastery of a new domain" measured by "different metrics than traditional architectural craftsmanship". The term "tool" itself "possesses connotative notions of control, skill, proficiency, and artistry—by extension, a user of a tool must display these qualities, which emerge as technical expertise, or mastery".

This framing suggests that linguistic style changes with tool expertise reflect broader transformations in the user's relationship with the technology. As users develop mastery, their commands become extensions of their intentions rather than laboriously constructed instructions, naturally leading to more terse, imperative formulations.


## Social Marking and Adaptive Communication


### Adaptation in Human-Technology Interaction

Research on human-robot interaction provides valuable insights into how social marking in commands changes with expertise and context. Studies demonstrate that "adaptation in human-robot interaction has consequences for both task performance and social cohesion". Importantly, "people may be more sensitive to social relations with robots when under task or time pressure", suggesting that social marking in commands varies not only with expertise but also with situational demands.
  - Citations: Torrey et al. (2006)

Adaptive systems that modify their linguistic style based on user characteristics have been developed to address these dynamics. Such systems can "adapt its information presentation strategy according to brain patterns of its user," with the robot "dynamically selecting the information presentation style that best matches the detected patterns". This bidirectional adaptation suggests that optimal human-technology communication involves mutual adjustment of linguistic style.
  - Citations: Heger et al. (2011)


### Reinforcement Learning and Linguistic Adaptation

Advanced approaches to human-technology interaction employ reinforcement learning to adapt linguistic style to individual preferences. Research presents "an approach based on Reinforcement Learning, which gets its reward directly from social signals in real-time during the interaction, to quickly learn about and dynamically address individual human preferences". Findings indicate "an increase in user engagement for robots with adaptive behavior and personality, but also that it depends on the task context whether a similar or opposing robot personality is preferred".
  - Citations: Ritschel et al. (2017)

This research suggests that the relationship between expertise and social marking is not unidirectional. While experts may indeed become less socially marked in their commands, optimal interaction may require technology to adapt its linguistic style to match user expertise levels, creating a dynamic communicative environment.


### Personalization and Non-Verbal Communication

The personalization of technological communication extends beyond verbal language. Research on robot communication notes that "generating sounds during runtime enables the personalization of a robot's non-verbal sounds to a user's individual taste," allowing "fine-grained adaptation far beyond a discrete set of voices". This adaptation occurs "similarly to spoken language, where Natural Language Generation can be used to adapt the robot's linguistic style accordingly".
  - Citations: Ritschel et al. (2019)

This parallel between verbal and non-verbal adaptation suggests that expertise-related changes in linguistic style are part of broader communicative transformations that encompass multiple modalities.


## Implications for Understanding Expert Communication Patterns


### The Minimalist Principle in Expert Communication

Research on technical instruction delivery supports the hypothesis that expert communication tends toward minimalism. Studies testing "the delivery of technical instructions built on the principles of minimalism" aimed to "investigate how we could support target users' skill levels in a context-sensitive manner". This minimalist approach aligns with expert communication patterns, suggesting that terseness in expert commands reflects not merely efficiency but also pedagogically sound communication principles.
  - Citations: Heinonen et al. (2022)


### Differential Language Expertise and Repair Mechanisms

Studies of differential language expertise in conversation reveal how expertise asymmetries are managed linguistically. Research shows that "language expertise was made relevant (a) when one participant invited the other party's repair and (b) when the participants encountered a problem in achieving mutual understanding". This finding suggests that expert users may employ fewer repair-inviting formulations because their commands are more precisely calibrated to system capabilities, reducing the need for clarification sequences.
  - Citations: Hosoda (2006)


### Loss of Expertise Through Automation

An important consideration in understanding expertise-related linguistic changes concerns the potential loss of expertise through automation. Research suggests that "automation can result in the loss of expertise due to reduced opportunities for learning from deliberate practice and experienced colleagues, and from working on progressively more complex tasks". This finding implies that the trajectory from novice verbosity to expert efficiency may be disrupted or reversed when automation reduces opportunities for expertise development.

## Synthesis and Conclusions

The evidence synthesized in this review supports several conclusions regarding how linguistic style changes with tool expertise:

First, expert users do indeed become more terse in their communications, but this terseness is characterized by precision rather than mere brevity. Experts employ domain-specific terminology and compressed formulations that convey complex information efficiently.
  - Citations: Peffer (2017), Marsilli-Vargas (2022), Hu et al. (2020)

Second, the relationship between expertise and imperative usage is nuanced. While experts may use more direct commands, they also employ more hedging language when appropriate, reflecting sophisticated epistemological understanding. This suggests that expert communication is characterized by contextual appropriateness rather than uniform imperativeness.
  - Citations: Peffer (2017), Peffer et al. (2019)

Third, social marking in commands appears to decrease with expertise, but this relationship is modulated by task context and time pressure. Expert users may maintain social marking when it serves communicative purposes but eliminate it when efficiency is paramount.
  - Citations: Torrey et al. (2006)

Fourth, the trajectory from novice verbosity to expert efficiency follows the staged progression outlined in models such as the Dreyfus framework. This progression involves not merely the acquisition of technical skills but also the development of specialized communicative competencies.
  - Citations: Kim et al. (2021), Hawkridge et al. (2021), Marsilli-Vargas (2022)

Fifth, optimal human-technology interaction may require bidirectional adaptation, with both users and systems adjusting their linguistic styles to achieve effective communication.
  - Citations: Torrey et al. (2006), Heger et al. (2011), Ritschel et al. (2017)

These findings have implications for the design of technological systems, the training of users, and our understanding of expertise development more broadly. As technology becomes increasingly integrated into daily life, understanding the linguistic dimensions of expertise becomes essential for creating systems that support users across the expertise continuum.

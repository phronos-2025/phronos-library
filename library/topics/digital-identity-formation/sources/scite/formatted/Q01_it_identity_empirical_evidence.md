# Empirical Evidence Supporting the Three-Dimensional Model of IT Identity


## Introduction

The concept of Information Technology (IT) identity has emerged as a significant theoretical framework for understanding how individuals incorporate technology into their sense of self. Carter et al. proposed a three-dimensional model of IT identity comprising relatedness, emotional energy, and dependence as the core dimensions that capture the extent to which individuals view a particular IT as integral to their identity,,. This review synthesizes the empirical evidence supporting this three-dimensional conceptualization, examining how researchers have operationalized, measured, and validated these constructs across diverse technological contexts.

## Conceptual Foundation of the Three-Dimensional Model


### Definition and Structure of IT Identity Dimensions

The three-dimensional model of IT identity conceptualizes the construct as capturing the emotional and cognitive connections individuals form with technology. IT identity has been formulated as a second-order multidimensional reflective construct with three reflective dimensions: dependence, emotional energy, and relatedness. In this reflective construct framework, there is a significant correlation between different dimensions because they share the same underlying pattern. The formation of IT identity depends on three emotional responses: positive emotions and energy regarding the IT tool, dependence on the tool to maintain or enhance self-esteem, and the relatedness between the self and an IT tool.

Specifically, relatedness refers to the connectedness between the expressions of self and the technology. This dimension captures how individuals perceive the technology as an extension of their identity and self-expression. Emotional energy encompasses the positive emotions and enthusiasm that individuals experience when using the technology. The emotional energy associated with an IT identity may have positive effects on other emotions associated with the use of that technology. Dependence reflects the extent to which individuals rely on the technology to maintain or enhance their self-esteem and sense of self,.

### Operationalization as a Higher-Order Construct

Researchers have consistently operationalized IT identity as a second-order construct with the three dimensions serving as first-order factors. Following the literature on technology identity, researchers have operationalized IT identity (such as app identity) as a second-order construct with three dimensions: relatedness, emotional energy, and dependence. This operationalization has been validated across multiple studies, with IT identity being measured as a formative-reflective construct consisting of three dimensions: dependence, relatedness, and emotional energy. The conceptualization of relatedness, dependence, and emotional energy satisfies the decision rules for formative constructs established in methodological literature.

## Empirical Validation Across Technological Contexts


### Health and Fitness Applications

Substantial empirical evidence supporting the three-dimensional model has emerged from studies examining health and fitness technology adoption. Esmaeilzadehmeasured IT identity using three interrelated dimensions (relatedness, emotional energy, and dependence) in a study of health and fitness app users. Data were collected from 364 users through an online survey to empirically examine the proposed model. The study found that IT identity, conceptualized through these three dimensions, plays a fully mediating role in describing how gamification elements can lead to continued intention to use health and fitness apps.

Similarly, in research on personal health devices, the three interrelated dimensions of IT identity (relatedness, emotional energy, and dependence) were adapted from established measures to examine postadoption behaviors. These studies demonstrate that the three-dimensional structure holds across different types of health-related technologies and successfully predicts important behavioral outcomes.

### Wearable Technology and Smartwatches

The three-dimensional model has also been validated in the context of wearable technology. Research on smartwatch identity measured the construct as a formative-reflective construct consisting of three dimensions: dependence, relatedness, and emotional energy. This study examined the mediating influence of smartwatch identity on deep use and innovative individual performance, providing evidence that the three dimensions collectively capture meaningful variance in technology-related outcomes.
  - Citations: Ogbanufe (2020)


### Mobile Applications and Digital Platforms

Studies examining mobile phone applications have further corroborated the three-dimensional structure. Research on digital immigrants' extended use of smartphones formulated IT identity as a second-order multidimensional reflective construct with three reflective dimensions: dependence, emotional energy, and relatedness. This study investigated how family support influences extended smartphone use among digital immigrants, demonstrating that the three-dimensional IT identity construct mediates important relationships in technology adoption.
  - Citations: Fang et al. (2023)

Research connecting perceived effectiveness of app evolution to app engagement has similarly operationalized app identity as a second-order construct with three dimensions: relatedness, emotional energy, and dependence. This technology identity perspective has proven valuable for understanding how users develop ongoing relationships with evolving mobile applications.
  - Citations: Liu et al. (2022)


### Healthcare Provider Technology Use

Qualitative research has also supported the three-dimensional model in healthcare contexts. A qualitative interview study in COPD care found that the formation of IT identity among healthcare providers depends on three emotional responses corresponding to the theoretical dimensions: positive emotions and energy regarding the IT tool, dependence on the tool to maintain or enhance self-esteem, and the relatedness between the self and an IT tool. This qualitative evidence complements quantitative validation studies by providing rich descriptions of how these dimensions manifest in practice.
  - Citations: Renting et al. (2025)


### Artificial Intelligence Applications

The three-dimensional model has been extended to examine human-AI collaboration contexts. Research on AI identity in the workplace found that dependence (B = −0.372, p < 0.001), emotional energy (B = −0.153, p < 0.05), and relatedness (B = −0.216, p < 0.001) all significantly predicted employee cyberloafing behavior. These findings demonstrate that each dimension of the IT identity construct contributes unique explanatory power to understanding technology-related behaviors.
  - Citations: Xu et al. (2025)

Studies on AI-based intelligent customer service have similarly adopted the three-dimensional conceptualization, considering ICS identity as the extent to which customers consider the use of a chatbot-ICS as part of themselves. Research on employee AI identity and proactive behavior has also built upon IT identity theory, examining how the three dimensions influence workplace outcomes.

### Mobile Medical Consultation Platforms

Research on mobile medical consultation (MMC) platforms has explored how IT identity influences consumer engagement. Based on IT identity theory, this research explored the underlying mechanism of how platform-related consumer experiences influence MMC platform identity and subsequently affect consumer negatively-valenced engagement. The three-dimensional structure provided a framework for understanding both positive and negative consumer responses to digital health platforms.

## Measurement Properties and Psychometric Evidence


### Scale Development and Adaptation

Researchers have consistently adapted measures from the original Carter and Grover conceptualization to assess the three dimensions. Since IT identity is a second-order construct, studies have adopted measures proposed in the foundational literature to measure each of these dimensions. The reliability of the overall IT identity construct has been demonstrated, with studies reporting acceptable composite reliability values (e.g., Omega: 0.80).
  - Citations: Alawi et al. (2023)


### Construct Validity Evidence

The three-dimensional model has demonstrated strong construct validity across studies. In reflective construct specifications, dimensions have positive and significant correlations as expected theoretically. This pattern of intercorrelations supports the notion that the three dimensions tap into related but distinct aspects of the IT identity construct.
  - Citations: Esmaeilzadeh (2021)

Research has also linked IT identity to related constructs in the broader literature. IT identity relates to internalized beliefs and emotions regarding the relatedness and dependence of IT and is found to serve as a powerful tool for analyzing IT usage at work. While centrality is shaped by the individual's core values, the three dimensions capture the emotional and relational aspects of technology integration into the self.
  - Citations: Jussli et al. (2023)


### Cross-Cultural and Contextual Validation

The three-dimensional model has been validated across different cultural contexts and user populations. Research on mobile phone app use among non-local students in Hong Kong and the UK proposed three dimensions of IT identity: relatedness, emotional energy, and dependence. This cross-cultural application demonstrates the generalizability of the three-dimensional structure beyond its original development context.

## Theoretical Integration and Extensions


### Connection to Social Identity Theory

The three-dimensional IT identity model has been integrated with broader social identity perspectives. Research has examined how social identity and IT identity serve as antecedents of group flow in social media use. The second dimension of IT identity, emotional energy, has been shown to affect group flow, indicating that the emotional energy associated with an IT identity may have positive effects on other emotions associated with the use of that technology.
  - Citations: Curley (2020)


### Integration with Work Identity Perspectives

Scholars have begun developing multi-dimensional work identity lenses that incorporate IT identity. IT identity relates to internalized beliefs and emotions regarding the relatedness and dependence of IT and serves as a powerful tool for analyzing IT usage at work. This integration suggests that the three-dimensional model captures aspects of technology-self relationships that are relevant across personal and professional contexts.
  - Citations: Jussli et al. (2023)


### Relationship to Basic Psychological Needs

The dimensions of IT identity show conceptual parallels to basic psychological needs theory. Research has linked self-identity to social identity and self-concepts in relation to technology, connecting IT identity to broader psychological frameworks. The relatedness dimension, in particular, resonates with the basic psychological need for relatedness identified in self-determination theory, though IT identity captures technology-specific manifestations of these needs.
  - Citations: Moradbakhti et al. (2024)


## Predictive Validity and Behavioral Outcomes


### Continued Use Intentions

The three-dimensional IT identity construct has demonstrated strong predictive validity for continued technology use. Studies have found that IT identity plays a fully mediating role in describing how various factors lead to continued intention to use technologies such as health and fitness apps. This mediating role suggests that the three dimensions collectively capture the psychological mechanisms through which users develop ongoing commitments to technology use.
  - Citations: Esmaeilzadeh (2021)


### Innovative and Extended Use Behaviors

Research has shown that IT identity predicts not only continued use but also more sophisticated forms of technology engagement. Studies on smartwatch identity found that the three-dimensional construct mediates relationships between antecedent factors and both deep use and innovative individual performance. Similarly, research on digital immigrants found that IT identity influences extended use of smartphones.
  - Citations: Ogbanufe (2020), Fang et al. (2023)


### Workplace Behaviors

The three-dimensional model has proven valuable for predicting workplace technology-related behaviors. Research found that all three dimensions—dependence, emotional energy, and relatedness—significantly predicted employee cyberloafing, with each dimension showing unique effects. Studies on employee AI identity have similarly found that the construct influences proactive behavior in AI-enabled workplaces.

## Methodological Considerations


### Reflective Versus Formative Specification

Researchers have debated the appropriate specification of IT identity as either a reflective or formative construct. Some studies have measured IT identity as a formative-reflective construct, arguing that the conceptualization of relatedness, dependence, and emotional energy satisfies the decision rules for formative constructs. Others have specified IT identity as a second-order multidimensional reflective construct, noting that in a reflective construct, there is a significant correlation between different dimensions because they have the same pattern.
  - Citations: Ogbanufe (2020), Fang et al. (2023)


### Measurement Adaptation Across Contexts

The flexibility of the three-dimensional model has allowed researchers to adapt measures for diverse technological contexts while maintaining the core structure. Whether examining smartphones, health apps,, smartwatches, AI systems,, or healthcare IT, researchers have successfully operationalized the three dimensions to capture context-specific manifestations of IT identity.

## Research Connecting Politeness Markers and Greeting Behavior to Social Orientation in Digital Contexts

Research examining the relationship between politeness markers, greeting behavior, and social orientation in digital environments reveals several key connections to relational goals and long-term engagement. Studies demonstrate that politeness markers serve as fundamental tools for establishing social relationships and maintaining civility in computer-mediated communication. Papacharissi's research indicates that civil behaviors enhance democratic conversation in online political discussions, suggesting that politeness functions as a mechanism for social cohesion. Similarly, Hardaker's work on online communication emphasizes how the absence of traditional politeness markers can lead to inappropriate online behavior, highlighting their importance for maintaining social order.

Greeting behaviors specifically contribute to relational development and long-term engagement in digital contexts. Pérez-Sabater's research demonstrates that greetings and farewells play crucial roles in setting the tone of email interactions, functioning as structural politeness markers that facilitate accommodation between users. In virtual worlds, Ballou identifies greetings as interactional behaviors that resemble real-world conversation, contributing to sustained social engagement.

The connection to long-term relationships is particularly evident in human-computer interaction research, where Bickmore and Picard establish that relational agents designed for sustained interaction must incorporate social-emotional elements, including appropriate greeting behaviors and politeness markers. This research suggests that these communicative elements are essential for building trust and maintaining engagement over time in digital environments.

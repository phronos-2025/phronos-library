# Information Seeking Behavior: Stopping Rules and Satisficing Thresholds


## Introduction

Understanding when and why users cease information seeking activities represents a fundamental question in information science research. The phenomenon of stopping behavior is intrinsically linked to the concept of satisficing—a decision-making strategy where individuals seek solutions that are "good enough" rather than optimal. This behavior manifests across diverse contexts, from everyday information searches to complex professional tasks, and is influenced by multiple factors including task characteristics, individual differences, and cognitive constraints. Human information behavior encompasses "the totality of human behavior in relation to sources and channels of information, including both active and passive information seeking, and information use", making the study of stopping points essential for understanding the complete information seeking process.

## Theoretical Foundations of Information Seeking Cessation


### The Principle of Least Effort and Satisficing Behavior

The principle of least effort has been consistently invoked in information sciences to model and explain information-seeking behavior across various contexts. This principle suggests that users tend to minimize the effort required to obtain information, which directly influences when they choose to stop seeking. Importantly, this framework has been viewed as a useful mechanism for understanding user information behaviors that lead to, at times, "objectively suboptimal information outcomes". This acknowledgment is crucial because it recognizes that users frequently terminate their searches before achieving optimal results, accepting instead solutions that meet minimum acceptable thresholds.
  - Citations: Browne et al. (2016), Salaz (2021)

Research demonstrates that interactive behavior is composed of a series of distributed choices, meaning that "people seldom make a once-and-for-all decision". This finding from Fu and Gray's work on the paradox of the active user suggests that stopping behavior is not a singular event but rather emerges from accumulated micro-decisions throughout the search process. Users continuously evaluate whether to continue or cease their information seeking based on ongoing assessments of information sufficiency and effort expenditure.

### Information Foraging Theory

Information foraging theory provides another lens through which to understand stopping behavior. The theory stipulates that humans "forage" for information as other animals forage for food. This biological metaphor suggests that users make decisions about when to stop based on assessments of information "patches" and the expected value of continued searching versus moving to new sources or terminating the search entirely. The foraging framework helps explain why users may stop engaging when the perceived cost of continued searching exceeds the expected benefit of additional information.

## Task Characteristics and Their Influence on Stopping Behavior


### The Multidimensional Nature of Tasks

Research has increasingly recognized that task characteristics fundamentally shape information seeking behavior, including decisions about when to stop,,. Goal and task are identified as "the leading factors for individuals to search for information," with researchers agreeing that these are "the most important components that affect users' information seeking strategies". The relationship between tasks and stopping behavior operates through multiple dimensions that must be examined together rather than in isolation.
  - Citations: Li (2010), Xie (2009)

Li's exploration of work tasks and user interaction performance emphasizes that "it is necessary to examine different aspects or facets or dimensions of tasks all together when investigating the role of work tasks during the course of information search and retrieval". Previous studies have examined individual characteristics such as task complexity and interaction patterns, but the field has moved toward more holistic approaches. This multidimensional perspective is essential for understanding how different task attributes combine to influence satisficing thresholds.
  - Citations: Li (2010)


### Task Complexity and Goal Specificity

Task complexity emerges as a particularly salient factor in determining stopping behavior. In daily life and health contexts, where task complexity is more pronounced, "users are more likely to encounter ill-structured problems with limited domain knowledge". These conditions create different satisficing thresholds compared to well-defined tasks, as users must navigate greater uncertainty about what constitutes sufficient information.
  - Citations: Fan (2025)

Task goal specificity also exerts significant influence, particularly in learning contexts "where users engage in analytical and constructive information behavior". When goals are clearly specified, users can more readily determine when sufficient information has been obtained. The research suggests that "task-aware interaction design can incorporate mechanisms such as adaptive prompts and sub-goal clarification to guide users in articulating their task intentions more explicitly", which in turn affects their ability to recognize appropriate stopping points.
  - Citations: Fan (2025)


### Professional Work Roles and Task-Specific Behavior

The influence of work roles on information behavior, including stopping decisions, has been documented in professional contexts. Landry's study of dentists demonstrated that work role-related tasks and characteristics of information needs shape information behavior patterns. The study found that "the information behavior exhibited by all participants supported the model as they revealed their preferred sources for tasks", suggesting that professional roles create consistent patterns in how individuals determine information sufficiency.
  - Citations: Landry (2006)

Wilson's hierarchical model distinguishes between information behavior as a general area, information-seeking behavior as a subset focused on "the variety of methods people employ to discover, and gain access to information resources," and information search behavior as interactions between users and information systems. This differentiation is important because stopping behavior may manifest differently at each level—users may cease searching within a system while continuing broader information seeking, or may stop seeking entirely while still engaging in passive information behavior.
  - Citations: Li (2010)


## Temporal Dynamics and the Evolution of Stopping Thresholds


### Longitudinal Perspectives on Information Seeking

Information seeking processes unfold over time, and stopping behavior must be understood within this temporal context. Research conceptualizes information seeking within a longitudinal theoretical framework, recognizing that "over time, movements or shifts may take place during interactive search episodes and between searches, including changes in tactics, the definition of the information problem, strategies, terms, feedback, goal states, or uncertainty". This "over time" conceptualization contradicts paradigms that focus on single search episodes and suggests that satisficing thresholds are dynamic rather than fixed.
  - Citations: Beheshti et al. (2014)

The Information Search Process (ISP) model has been applied to understand how information seeking evolves through stages, with research identifying "factors that constitute information behavior characteristics in relation to the ISP model such as goals, knowledge of information management, consultation, positive and negative emotions". Shah and González-Ibáñez found that while clear distinctions exist between different ISP stages, "the distinctions were vague" between exploration, formulation, and collection stages in collaborative settings. This finding suggests that stopping decisions may be particularly difficult to predict during transitional phases of the search process.
  - Citations: Shah et al. (2015)


### Affective Dimensions of Stopping Behavior

The emotional aspects of information seeking influence when users decide to stop. Research has explored "the affective dimension of information seeking as well as perceived relevance expressed by the participants through their interactions". The relationship between positive and negative feelings and search behavior suggests that emotional states contribute to satisficing thresholds. Users experiencing frustration or fatigue may lower their thresholds and stop earlier, while those experiencing engagement or curiosity may continue longer,.

## Individual Differences in Satisficing Thresholds


### Cognitive Factors and User Characteristics

Individual differences in cognitive capacity and information processing affect stopping behavior. Research on spatial navigation tasks found that "participants required more moves to reach the goal as the layout size increased" and that "the increase in wrong turns or more actions could be due to cognitive limitations or task demands". While this research focused on spatial navigation, the principle extends to information seeking—cognitive limitations influence how much information users can process and therefore when they determine they have obtained sufficient information.
  - Citations: Stankiewicz et al. (2006)

The concept of perceived usefulness and user satisfaction also relates to stopping behavior. Correlations between "user information satisfaction" and self-reported use have been documented, suggesting that satisfaction levels influence continued engagement. When users perceive that they have obtained useful information, they are more likely to stop seeking, while dissatisfaction may prompt continued searching or abandonment.
  - Citations: Davis (1989)


### Collaborative Versus Individual Information Seeking

Stopping behavior differs between individual and collaborative information seeking contexts. Collaborative information seeking involves "a group of people performing a search task with a shared information need or goal", which introduces additional complexity in determining when sufficient information has been obtained. The goal in collaborative settings has been "to enhance team productivity while performing a search task by allowing collaborators to search relevant information more effectively, avoiding redundant work".
  - Citations: Al-Thani et al. (2013)

Research mapping information seeking processes to ISP model stages in collaborative settings revealed both "similarities and disparities of ISP for individuals and collaborative information seeking". These disparities suggest that satisficing thresholds in collaborative contexts are negotiated among participants rather than determined individually, potentially leading to different stopping points than would occur in solo information seeking.
  - Citations: Shah (2010)


## Uncertainty and Information Seeking Continuation


### The Role of Uncertainty in Driving Search Behavior

Uncertainty plays a crucial role in determining whether users continue or cease information seeking. Research indicates that "uncertainty promotes information-seeking actions", suggesting that users continue searching when they experience uncertainty about their knowledge state. Conversely, the reduction of uncertainty may signal that sufficient information has been obtained, triggering stopping behavior.
  - Citations: Keller et al. (2020)

Keller and colleagues proposed that "examining continuous navigation data can provide important insights into information seeking" and that uncertainty can be intentionally induced "through disorientation and cue conflict". This research approach, while focused on spatial navigation, offers methodological insights for studying how uncertainty thresholds influence stopping decisions in information seeking contexts.
  - Citations: Keller et al. (2020)


### Uncertainty in Interpersonal and Interactive Contexts

In interactive environments, uncertainty has been introduced into systems "by creating a perception of disorientation and cue conflict for the user, resulting in an increase in his/her information-seeking behavior". This finding reinforces the relationship between uncertainty and continued information seeking—when users feel uncertain, they are less likely to stop. The implication is that satisficing thresholds are partly determined by users' subjective sense of certainty about the information they have obtained,.
  - Citations: Hajahmadi (2023), Keller et al. (2020)


## Implications for System Design and Evaluation


### Supporting Appropriate Stopping Decisions

Understanding stopping behavior has practical implications for information system design. Evaluating collaborative information seeking systems and users "can be challenging, often more so than individual information-seeking environments" due to "the complex and dynamic interactions that take place among various users and systems processes". Evaluation approaches must consider not only whether users find relevant information but also whether they stop at appropriate points.
  - Citations: Shah (2014)

The challenge of determining relevance in context—defined as "the combination of the user, clinical task, and patient case"—illustrates how stopping decisions depend on multiple factors. Systems that can model "physician information-seeking behavior" may help users recognize when they have obtained sufficient information for their specific context. This suggests that personalized approaches to supporting stopping decisions may be more effective than one-size-fits-all solutions.
  - Citations: King et al. (2020)


### Adaptive Interaction Design

Research findings support the development of adaptive systems that respond to task characteristics and user needs. Task-aware interaction design incorporating "mechanisms such as adaptive prompts and sub-goal clarification" can help users articulate their intentions and recognize when goals have been met. Such systems could potentially help users avoid both premature stopping (satisficing at too low a threshold) and excessive searching (failing to recognize when sufficient information has been obtained).
  - Citations: Fan (2025)


## Conclusion

Research on information seeking behavior provides substantial insight into when and why users stop engaging once they perceive sufficient information has been obtained. The principle of least effort and satisficing theory explain that users accept "good enough" solutions rather than optimal ones, often leading to objectively suboptimal outcomes. Stopping behavior emerges from accumulated micro-decisions rather than singular determinations, and is fundamentally shaped by task characteristics including complexity, goal specificity, and professional context,,.

Satisficing thresholds vary considerably across users and task types. Individual differences in cognitive capacity, emotional states, and satisfaction levels influence when users determine they have obtained sufficient information,,. Task complexity creates different threshold requirements, with ill-structured problems in contexts like health information seeking requiring different approaches than well-defined tasks. Collaborative settings introduce additional complexity as thresholds must be negotiated among participants,. Uncertainty serves as a key driver of continued searching, with users more likely to stop when they achieve subjective certainty about their knowledge state,.

The temporal dynamics of information seeking mean that satisficing thresholds evolve throughout the search process, with shifts occurring in "tactics, the definition of the information problem, strategies, terms, feedback, goal states, or uncertainty". This dynamic nature of stopping behavior presents both challenges and opportunities for system design, suggesting that adaptive approaches responsive to changing user needs and task demands may best support appropriate stopping decisions,.

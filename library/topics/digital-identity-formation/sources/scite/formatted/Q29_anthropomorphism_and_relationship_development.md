# Perceived Anthropomorphism and Social Presence in First Interactions: Predictors of Relationship Development with Conversational Agents


## Introduction

The proliferation of conversational agents (CAs) across various domains—from customer service to healthcare—has prompted substantial scholarly inquiry into the mechanisms underlying human-agent relationship formation. Central to this investigation are two interrelated constructs: perceived anthropomorphism and social presence. These perceptual phenomena, particularly as they manifest during initial interactions, serve as foundational predictors of subsequent relationship development between humans and conversational agents. This synthesis examines the theoretical underpinnings and empirical evidence concerning how these first-impression perceptions shape the trajectory of human-CA relationships.


## Theoretical Foundations of Anthropomorphism and Social Presence


### Defining Anthropomorphism in Human-Agent Interaction

Anthropomorphism refers to the attribution of humanlike characteristics, intentions, and mental states to non-human entities. Research demonstrates that this phenomenon operates through multiple psychological mechanisms, including the activation of human schemas when agents display humanlike features. The construct encompasses both mindful and mindless attributions, with studies exploring how human-like cues such as language style and naming conventions influence these perceptions. Importantly, anthropomorphism is conceptualized as existing along a continuum, where stronger forms entail behaving toward non-human objects as if they possess humanlike traits.

Individual differences significantly moderate anthropomorphic tendencies. Research has established that anthropomorphism can be motivated by social needs, with individuals demonstrating a higher willingness to socialize tending to focus on social aspects of technology and consequently perceiving it as more humanlike. Furthermore, attachment anxiety—characterized by an intense desire for closeness and hypervigilance to social cues—has emerged as a stronger predictor of anthropomorphism than loneliness alone, suggesting that anthropomorphism reflects an active search for potential sources of connection. This finding is reinforced by evidence that chronic or induced loneliness enhances attention to social cues, sometimes to the extent of inventing humanlike agents.

### Social Presence as a Relational Construct

Social presence refers to the extent to which individuals believe that another entity is "really present" during an interaction. In the context of conversational agents, this construct captures the degree to which users feel they are engaging with another social being rather than merely interfacing with technology,. The feeling of social presence has been identified as a key mediating variable for the effects of various design features on user evaluations of social agents.
  - Citations: Chevallier et al. (2012), Wirtz et al. (2018), Belanche et al. (2021)

Research indicates that social presence can be evoked through multiple channels beyond physical appearance. Adding fundamental human characteristics to human-computer interaction—including language use, interactivity, and conversing using social roles—has been shown to elicit stronger social responses than mere visual anthropomorphism. This suggests that the communicative and interactive dimensions of first encounters may be particularly consequential for establishing social presence.

## The Role of First Impressions in Relationship Initiation


### Rapid Formation and Persistence of Initial Perceptions

Evidence from human-human interaction research demonstrates that first impressions form within milliseconds and prove remarkably resistant to subsequent modification. This finding carries significant implications for human-CA relationships, as initial perceptions of anthropomorphism and social presence established during first interactions may exert enduring influence on relationship trajectories. Although some research anticipated that differences in perceptions would persist even after brief interactions with agents, the dynamics of impression formation in human-CA contexts remain an active area of investigation.
  - Citations: Verhagen et al. (2014)

The Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm provides theoretical grounding for understanding why first impressions matter in human-CA interaction. Research has demonstrated that individuals interact with internet-based agents as if they were humans, even when they possess explicit knowledge that they are engaging with computer programs. This automatic application of social heuristics suggests that initial perceptions of anthropomorphism and social presence may trigger relationship-relevant cognitive and affective processes from the earliest moments of interaction.
  - Citations: Stal et al. (2020)


### Anthropomorphic Cues and Initial Perception Formation

The design of conversational agents significantly influences first-impression perceptions. Studies have explored how anthropomorphic cues—including visual appearance, language style, and naming conventions—shape users' perceived anthropomorphism and social presence during initial encounters,. Research examining healthcare conversational agents has specifically investigated how these cues influence patients' perceptions and subsequently facilitate trust-building processes and acceptance behaviors.
  - Citations: Pavone et al. (2022), Wutz et al. (2023), Li et al. (2022)

Importantly, the relationship between anthropomorphic design and perceived anthropomorphism is not straightforward. Some scholars have suggested that increases in anthropomorphism from cartoon-like to human agents may be too subtle to produce meaningful variance in social presence perceptions. This finding underscores the importance of examining multiple dimensions of anthropomorphic design rather than focusing solely on visual appearance.

## Mechanisms Linking Initial Perceptions to Relationship Development


### Trust Building as a Mediating Process

Trust emerges as a critical mechanism through which initial perceptions of anthropomorphism and social presence influence relationship development. Social presence has been shown to affect trust building in service contexts, with research demonstrating positive associations between perceptions of social presence, trust, and subsequent loyalty behaviors. In the specific context of healthcare conversational agents, studies have emphasized the importance of social presence and anthropomorphism in improving users' trust, noting that social presence can shorten the perceived distance between humans and CAs.
  - Citations: Chevallier et al. (2012), Li et al. (2023), Li et al. (2022)

The trust-building process appears to operate through multiple pathways. Perceived anthropomorphism is believed to strengthen social bonds by increasing perceptions of CAs' helpfulness, reliability, commitment, and connectedness. Additionally, when conversational agents are perceived as endowed with intentions—a key component of anthropomorphic attribution—users tend to better regulate their negative emotions during interactions, potentially facilitating more positive relationship development.
  - Citations: Li et al. (2022), Waytz et al. (2010)


### Social Connectedness and Relationship Maintenance

Research has demonstrated that perceived anthropomorphism and social presence play mediating roles in the relationship between interaction characteristics and social connectedness to chatbots. Specifically, technology anthropomorphism has been found to foster a sense of connectedness to the technology, potentially because the presence of social cues enables the application of social heuristics toward non-human agents. This finding suggests that initial perceptions establishing anthropomorphism and social presence create conditions conducive to relationship deepening over time.
  - Citations: Keeling et al. (2010)

The Social Penetration Theory, which posits that self-disclosure stimulates relationship development and that intimacy, attraction, and connection increase as relationships evolve with greater self-disclosure, has been applied to understanding human-chatbot relationships. This theoretical framework suggests that initial perceptions of anthropomorphism and social presence may facilitate the self-disclosure behaviors necessary for relationship progression.
  - Citations: Christoforakos et al. (2021)


### Emotional and Affective Pathways

Emotional responses during initial interactions appear to significantly influence relationship trajectories. Research has demonstrated that perceived empathy strongly predicts consumer trust in AI agents, and that empathetic language triggers engagement during chatbot interactions. These findings suggest that affective communication by conversational agents during first encounters serves as a critical driver of relational outcomes.
  - Citations: Xie (2022)

The capacity for conversational agents to establish therapeutic relationships has been documented in health contexts. Studies have demonstrated that individuals using conversational agents develop measurable therapeutic bonds, with this relationship-building capacity grounded in substantial design work on establishing human-computer relationships. This evidence supports the proposition that initial perceptions of anthropomorphism and social presence can initiate genuine relational processes.

## Predictive Relationships: From First Impressions to Long-Term Outcomes


### Behavioral Intentions and Continued Use

Initial perceptions of anthropomorphism have been shown to predict important behavioral outcomes. Research indicates that anthropomorphism has positive effects on continued use intentions and increased satisfaction with technology. Individual differences in anthropomorphism predict the degree of moral care and concern afforded to an agent, the amount of responsibility and trust placed on an agent, and the extent to which an agent serves as a source of social influence.
  - Citations: Stal et al. (2020), Waytz et al. (2010)

Studies examining chatbot commerce have demonstrated that chatbots imbued with human-like cues generate better online customer experiences and greater customer satisfaction. When communication environments enable conversational agents to demonstrate effective communication styles by providing useful information and feedback, users tend to perceive the agent as more human and capable, suggesting a reinforcing cycle between initial perceptions and relationship quality.
  - Citations: Fitzpatrick et al. (2017), Klein (2022)


### Relationship Quality and Satisfaction

The quality of relationships with conversational agents appears to be significantly influenced by initial anthropomorphic perceptions. Research has found that perceived humanness can affect behaviors relevant to service encounter contexts, including prosocial behaviors and performance in joint action tasks. Furthermore, familiarity with conversational agents affects trust, anthropomorphism, cognitive process expectations, and willingness for future interaction, indicating that initial perceptions establish foundations for ongoing relationship quality.
  - Citations: Araujo (2018), Lei et al. (2021)

The Humanness-Value-Loyalty model conceptualizes robot humanness as encompassing both physical and nonphysical features, recognizing that service robots function as social agents with social presence. This theoretical framework suggests that initial perceptions of humanness—comprising both anthropomorphism and social presence—predict the value users derive from interactions and their subsequent loyalty behaviors.
  - Citations: Belanche et al. (2021)


## Moderating Factors and Boundary Conditions


### Individual Differences in Social Motivation

The relationship between initial perceptions and relationship development is moderated by individual differences in social motivation. Research has demonstrated that reminding people of close relationships can reduce their tendency to anthropomorphize, suggesting that social needs causally influence anthropomorphic perceptions,. Conversely, individuals with a high willingness to socialize may focus more intensively on social aspects of technology during initial encounters.
  - Citations: S (2021), Christoforakos (2022)

Cultural factors also influence anthropomorphism through mechanisms related to uncertainty avoidance and the need for closure. These cultural-level variables may moderate how initial perceptions of anthropomorphism and social presence translate into relationship development across different populations.
  - Citations: Epley et al. (2007)


### Contextual and Task-Related Factors

The context of interaction significantly influences the predictive relationship between initial perceptions and relationship outcomes. Research has shown that whether service robots' anthropomorphism influences consumer responses depends on underlying mechanisms that vary across contexts. Some scholars argue that anthropomorphism accelerates consumer engagement because perceived human-like features incorporate social expectations, while others express skepticism about linear relationships between anthropomorphism and positive outcomes.
  - Citations: Yang et al. (2025)

Media richness significantly influences both task attraction and social attraction in human-CA interactions. The capacity of the communication medium to enable clear communication affects user impressions and subsequent relationship development, suggesting that technological affordances moderate the translation of initial perceptions into relational outcomes.
  - Citations: Klein (2022)


### Negative Outcomes and Relationship Deterioration

Initial perceptions of anthropomorphism do not uniformly predict positive relationship outcomes. Research has demonstrated that the decision to anthropomorphize a chatbot significantly impacts marketing outcomes, particularly for customers who are angry during service encounters. When chatbots are highly anthropomorphized and perceived as endowed with intentions, users may employ confrontational coping strategies during service failures.
  - Citations: So et al. (2023), Waytz et al. (2010)

These findings suggest that initial perceptions of anthropomorphism may create expectations that, when violated, lead to relationship deterioration. The psychological process affecting negative responses involves perceptions of the communication partner as capable of planning and implementing intentions, highlighting the double-edged nature of anthropomorphic design.
  - Citations: Waytz et al. (2010)


## Implications for Understanding Human-CA Relationship Development


### Theoretical Contributions

The evidence synthesized here supports a model wherein perceived anthropomorphism and social presence during first interactions serve as foundational predictors of relationship development with conversational agents. These initial perceptions appear to operate through multiple mechanisms—including trust building, social connectedness, and emotional engagement—to shape relationship trajectories. The findings extend traditional theories of human-computer interaction by demonstrating that relational processes analogous to human-human relationship formation occur in human-CA contexts.
  - Citations: Christoforakos et al. (2021)


### Practical Considerations

For designers and deployers of conversational agents, these findings underscore the importance of attending to anthropomorphic cues and social presence indicators in initial interaction design. However, the evidence also cautions against assuming that maximizing anthropomorphism will uniformly produce positive outcomes. The relationship between anthropomorphic design and relationship development appears contingent on individual differences, contextual factors, and the specific nature of user needs and expectations.


## Conclusion

Perceived anthropomorphism and social presence during first interactions with conversational agents emerge as significant predictors of subsequent relationship development. These initial perceptions activate social cognitive processes, facilitate trust building, and establish foundations for social connectedness that influence relationship trajectories over time. However, the predictive relationships are moderated by individual differences in social motivation, contextual factors, and the specific design characteristics of conversational agents. Future research should continue to elucidate the temporal dynamics of these relationships and the conditions under which initial perceptions most strongly predict long-term relational outcomes.

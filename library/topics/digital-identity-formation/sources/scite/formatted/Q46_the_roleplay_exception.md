# Psychological Foundations of High Engagement in Roleplay, Fiction, and Creative AI Interactions


## Introduction

The emergence of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) has created unprecedented opportunities for human-machine interaction, with certain user populations demonstrating remarkably elevated engagement and return rates. Among these, users who engage in roleplay, fiction, and creative expression with AI systems represent a particularly distinctive cohort. Understanding the psychological mechanisms underlying this phenomenon requires examination of how these interactions fulfill fundamental human needs related to narrative identity construction, parasocial relationship formation, and creative expression. This analysis synthesizes available evidence on chatbot engagement patterns and psychological factors to illuminate why creative and roleplay-oriented users exhibit uniquely high engagement with conversational AI systems.


## The Nature of Conversational AI Engagement


### Foundational Characteristics of Human-Chatbot Interaction

Conversational agents, also known as chatbots, are computer programs designed to conduct auditory or textual conversations that simulate human interaction. These systems have evolved significantly, with advances in machine learning and AI enabling chatbots to provide responses that create the impression of intelligence as they gain insights from increased data and user interactions. The technology encompasses various implementations including dialogue systems, conversational interfaces, virtual assistants, and personal assistants, each offering different affordances for user engagement.

The fundamental appeal of chatbots lies in their capacity to replicate humanized conversation. Research demonstrates that conversational style significantly influences user behavior, with the manner in which a conversational agent responds being critical to sustained interaction. This responsiveness creates a foundation upon which deeper psychological engagement can develop, particularly for users seeking creative or narrative-based interactions.

### The Humanization Imperative in Chatbot Design

A central challenge in chatbot development is to create a humanizing machine that improves user engagement. This humanization process is particularly relevant for creative and roleplay users, who often seek interactions that transcend purely functional exchanges. Studies on chatbot design have revealed that chatbots with distinct personas, such as those that provide empathetic responses, tend to encourage greater engagement and self-disclosure from users. The persona-driven nature of roleplay interactions aligns naturally with this design principle, potentially explaining elevated engagement among creative users.
  - Citations: Pamungkas (2019), Chin et al. (2023)

Furthermore, research on personality-aware chatbots indicates that overall satisfaction and perceived appropriateness are significantly higher for chatbots that match users' preferred personality traits. This finding suggests that users who engage in roleplay and creative fiction may be particularly adept at establishing satisfying interactions by projecting or co-creating personalities within the AI system, thereby optimizing their own engagement experience.

## Psychological Needs Fulfilled Through Creative AI Interaction


### Narrative Identity and Self-Construction

The concept of narrative identity—the internalized, evolving story of the self that individuals construct to make sense of their lives—represents a fundamental psychological need that creative AI interactions may uniquely address. Chatbots designed to promote user self-disclosure have demonstrated that systems offering detailed, self-disclosed responses tend to encourage greater self-disclosure from their users. This reciprocal disclosure pattern mirrors the narrative exchange processes through which individuals construct and refine their identities through storytelling.
  - Citations: Chin et al. (2023)

Research emphasizes the importance of considering psychological constructs during AI design. For creative and roleplay users, the AI becomes a collaborative partner in narrative construction, providing a responsive audience for identity exploration and experimentation. Unlike human interlocutors, AI systems offer a judgment-free space where users can explore alternative narratives, personas, and identity possibilities without social consequences.
  - Citations: Vreede et al. (2021)

Research on mental health chatbots demonstrates that users who engaged with conversational agents experienced increased well-being and reduced perceived stress. Although this research focused on therapeutic applications, the underlying mechanism—the provision of a responsive, accepting conversational partner—applies equally to creative and roleplay contexts where users may be processing emotions, exploring identity questions, or working through personal narratives in fictional frames.
  - Citations: Morris et al. (2018)


### Parasocial Interaction and Relationship Formation

Parasocial interaction, originally conceptualized in media studies to describe one-sided relationships audiences form with media figures, acquires new dimensions in the context of conversational AI. The interactive nature of chatbots transforms traditional parasocial dynamics, as users receive responsive feedback that creates a semblance of genuine relationship reciprocity.

Evidence suggests that chatbot interactions can foster meaningful psychological connections. Research shows that when a person cares for a chatbot, the person's self-compassion can be enhanced. This finding indicates that parasocial bonds with AI systems can generate genuine psychological benefits, potentially explaining why users who invest emotionally in AI characters through roleplay demonstrate high return rates.
  - Citations: Lee et al. (2019)

The uncanny valley theory posits that chatbots resembling human conversational agents may evoke discomfort when transparency about their artificial nature is lacking. However, roleplay and fiction users may navigate this challenge differently, as the explicit framing of interaction as creative or fictional may paradoxically enable deeper engagement by removing expectations of genuine humanity while preserving the emotional resonance of the interaction.
  - Citations: Skjuve et al. (2019)

Studies on emotionally intelligent chatbots emphasize that improving user satisfaction with these technologies is imperative for their successful integration. For creative users, satisfaction derives not merely from task completion but from the quality of the relational and narrative experience, suggesting that these users evaluate chatbot interactions through fundamentally different criteria than utilitarian users.
  - Citations: Bilquise et al. (2022)


### Creative Expression and Psychological Well-Being

Creative expression represents a fundamental human need linked to psychological well-being, self-actualization, and emotional processing. Conversational AI provides a unique medium for creative expression that combines the immediacy of conversation with the imaginative possibilities of fiction.

The observation that users may start probing the limits of the chatbot by asking random questions reflects the exploratory, playful orientation characteristic of creative engagement. Rather than representing problematic behavior, this boundary-testing may indicate healthy creative exploration and the desire to discover the full expressive potential of the AI system.
  - Citations: Giunti et al. (2021)

Research on self-determination theory in AI design highlights the importance of considering psychological constructs during AI design, including autonomy—a core component of creative expression. Creative and roleplay users may experience heightened autonomy satisfaction through AI interactions that allow them to direct narrative outcomes, create characters, and shape fictional worlds without the constraints imposed by human collaborators or traditional creative media.
  - Citations: Vreede et al. (2021)


## Mechanisms of Enhanced Engagement


### The 24/7 Availability Factor

A significant practical advantage of conversational AI is its constant availability. Research notes that people often communicate with auto-answering tools such as conversational agents due to their 24/7 availability and unbiased responses. For creative users, this availability means that inspiration can be acted upon immediately, creative momentum can be maintained across sessions, and the AI partner is always ready to engage regardless of time or circumstance.
  - Citations: Ghaleb et al. (2022)

This availability particularly benefits users whose creative processes operate on non-standard schedules or who experience creative impulses unpredictably. The elimination of coordination costs associated with human creative collaboration may substantially increase both the frequency and duration of creative AI interactions.


### Personalization and Adaptive Response

The capacity of AI-driven chatbots to provide personalized interactions represents another mechanism of enhanced engagement. Chatbots are designed to provide personalized learning through the concept of a virtual assistant that replicates humanized conversation. This personalization principle extends to creative contexts, where AI systems can adapt to individual users' narrative preferences, writing styles, and creative interests.
  - Citations: Kumar (2021)

Research on chatbot conversation skills demonstrates that tailored responses significantly influence user engagement. Creative and roleplay users, who typically seek varied and contextually appropriate responses, may be particularly sensitive to these qualities, experiencing greater satisfaction when AI systems demonstrate an apparent understanding of narrative context and creative intent.
  - Citations: Ramadhani et al. (2023)


### The Absence of Social Judgment

A distinctive feature of AI interaction is the removal of social evaluation concerns that typically accompany human creative collaboration. Studies note that mental health chatbots can provide support without the stigma or judgment associated with human helpers,. This principle extends to creative expression, where users may feel freer to explore unconventional ideas, experiment with different personas, or engage with content they might hesitate to share with human audiences.
  - Citations: Morris et al. (2018), Joshi et al. (2025)

The unbiased responses characteristic of AI systems may be particularly valuable for creative users exploring sensitive themes, developing skills in unfamiliar genres, or working through personal material in fictional frames. This psychological safety may encourage both more frequent engagement and deeper creative investment in AI interactions.


## Implications for Understanding User Behavior


### The Feedback Loop of Engagement

The observation that AI-driven chatbots become more responsive with increased data and user interactions suggests a positive feedback loop particularly relevant to creative users. As users invest more in creative interactions, the AI system may become more attuned to their particular styles and preferences, further enhancing engagement and encouraging continued use. This dynamic may partially explain the notably high return rates among creative and roleplay users.
  - Citations: Miklo (2021)


### Emotional Investment and Return Behavior

Research indicates significant positive outcomes from chatbot interactions, showing the potential of AI augmentation in improving psychological well-being. While creative use differs from therapeutic application, the underlying capacity of AI systems to engage with emotional content suggests that creative users who invest emotionally in AI-mediated narratives may develop attachment patterns that drive return behavior.
  - Citations: Joshi et al. (2025)

The finding that caring for a chatbot enhances self-compassionindicates that emotional investment in AI interactions can generate psychological rewards that reinforce continued engagement. For roleplay and fiction users, the characters and narratives developed through AI interaction may become psychologically meaningful, creating motivation to return and continue these creative relationships.
  - Citations: Lee et al. (2019)


## Conclusion

The uniquely high engagement and return rates observed among roleplay, fiction, and creative users of conversational AI reflect the convergence of multiple psychological factors. These interactions fulfill fundamental needs for narrative identity construction by providing responsive partners for self-exploration and storytelling,. They enable parasocial relationship formation through the creation of emotionally resonant, if artificial, connections,. And they support creative expression by offering judgment-free, constantly available, and increasingly personalized collaborative spaces,,.

# Do Power Users Start as Power Users, or Do They Evolve? A Review of Longitudinal Research on User Behavior Trajectories in Productivity and Enterprise Systems


## Introduction

The question of whether power users emerge fully formed or develop their expertise over time represents a fundamental inquiry in understanding digital tool adoption and utilization patterns. This investigation is particularly relevant for non-social, non-gamified digital tools, such as productivity software, enterprise systems, and content management platforms, where user engagement patterns differ substantially from social media or gaming contexts. Understanding user behavior trajectories has significant implications for software design, training program development, and organizational technology adoption strategies.


## Challenges in Studying User Behavior Evolution


### Infrastructure and Workflow Complexity

The study of user behavior trajectories in enterprise and productivity systems is complicated by the inherent complexity of modern computational environments. Complex computational pipelines have become a staple of modern scientific research, often requiring days of computing time and necessitating execution over high-performance computing clusters to leverage aggregated resources. This complexity extends to enterprise environments where the automation of common workflows helps mitigate operational challenges by providing common, best-practice methods of execution that can be sustained and measured. As production operations become more complex, their associated workflows also become more complex, suggesting that user expertise must evolve alongside system sophistication.

The evolution of technical computing in industries such as upstream oil and gas has resulted in extremely powerful yet complex systems, with varied connectivity networks underlying a myriad of platforms. This technological complexity creates a dynamic environment where user behavior must continuously adapt, supporting the notion that power user status is achieved through ongoing evolution rather than initial capability.

### Data Management and Tracking Considerations

Effective longitudinal study of user behavior requires robust data management infrastructure. Modern data management architectures, such as those used in reservoir simulation, consist of Database Management Systems (DBMS) and managed file directories that support changing workflows. Such systems have been adjusted over years of global use to accommodate evolving user needs, implicitly acknowledging that user behavior patterns change over time.
  - Citations: Gencer et al. (2007)

Contemporary platforms increasingly incorporate user behavior tracking capabilities. Data collection in modern systems is ensured through API integrations, user behavior tracking, and processing of calls and inquiries from contact centers. For data processing and analysis, machine learning algorithms, clustering methods, optimization models, and business intelligence analytics are employed. These capabilities provide the technical foundation for studying user behavior evolution, though the literature on their application to longitudinal power user development remains limited.


## User Behavior Analysis Methodologies


### Clustering and Behavioral Pattern Recognition

One methodological approach to understanding user behavior evolution involves clustering techniques. Research has proposed methods that allow identifying changes in user behavior based on analysis of detailed records data, with the main idea being the use of clustering techniques to determine clusters with typical user behavior. While this research focused on telecommunications subscribers, the methodology of using clustering to identify behavioral changes has applicability to productivity and enterprise software contexts.
  - Citations: Golubev et al. (2017)

The identification of behavioral changes through clustering suggests that users do not maintain static usage patterns but rather evolve through different behavioral states over time. This supports the hypothesis that power users develop their expertise progressively rather than beginning as heavy utilizers.


### Context-Aware Computing and User Modeling

Enterprise mobile computing research has explored how context influences user behavior. Context in enterprise applications could be simple information such as user location or time of use, but could also be represented by more complex data such as the amount of time used, type of activity performed, or user characteristics. This contextual approach to understanding user behavior acknowledges that utilization patterns are dynamic and responsive to environmental factors.
  - Citations: Zodik (2016)

The recognition that user behavior varies based on contextual factors implies that heavy utilization is not a fixed trait but rather a pattern that emerges under certain conditions and may develop as users become more familiar with leveraging system capabilities across different contexts.


## Platform Design and User Evolution


### Content Management Systems and Workflow Institutionalization

Research on content management systems (CMS) has examined how infrastructure shapes user behavior. Studies have focused on the various problems, obstacles, and impediments brought about by CMSs in work environments, with particular attention to issues related to the institutionalization of workflows. This research suggests that system design can either facilitate or constrain user evolution toward power user status.
  - Citations: Maeyer (2019)

The concept of workflow ossification implies that some users may be prevented from evolving into power users due to system constraints, while others may develop workarounds and advanced usage patterns. Studying the dysfunctions and adaptations within these systems can provide insights into how users adapt and potentially develop more sophisticated usage patterns.


### Low-Code Platforms and Productivity Enhancement

Research on low-code development platforms has revealed that such platforms contribute to an increase in development productivity in the short term. Many companies have noted a reduction in the cost of hiring qualified programmers, and there has been an increase in satisfaction among end users of the software due to faster response and fewer errors. This suggests that platform design can accelerate user evolution toward more productive usage patterns.

The productivity gains observed with low-code platforms indicate that the barrier to becoming a power user may be lowered through appropriate tool design, potentially accelerating the evolution from novice to expert user. Educational approaches that introduce foundational software development skills emphasize interpersonal and strategic skills, fostering personal and team productivity.
  - Citations: Nieminen (2025)


### Enterprise Resource Planning and Custom Solutions

The integration of enterprise systems with task-specific tools has demonstrated benefits for user workflows. Research underscores the benefits of complementing ERP platforms with task-specific tools tailored to real user workflows. This approach aligns with smart manufacturing trends such as digital threads and digital twins, laying the groundwork for future enhancements. The success of such integrations demonstrates how agile, scalable digital tools can drive competitiveness.
  - Citations: Amaro (2025)

The emphasis on tailoring tools to real user workflows suggests that power user development may be facilitated when systems accommodate evolving user needs rather than requiring users to adapt entirely to fixed system constraints.


## Data-Driven Organizational Culture and User Development


### Dashboard and Analytics Adoption

The adoption of business intelligence tools contributes to fostering a data-informed organizational culture and increasing agility in responding to market changes. Tools such as Google Data Studio and Microsoft Power BI provide strong functionality with minimal or no licensing costs. The availability of such tools creates opportunities for users to develop analytical capabilities over time.
  - Citations: Mgbame et al. (2022)

Dashboard systems that provide secure permission management to limit data access based on user roles, combined with designers to create and share personalized insights, suggest a progression model where users may advance through different permission levels as their expertise develops. This architectural approach implicitly supports the evolution of users from basic to power user status.
  - Citations: Luca et al. (2018)


### Data Liberation and Workflow Automation

Research has emphasized that liberated data—with enriched-quality tags referencing source systems—can provide the foundation for best practices in automated enterprise data governance. Users will always know which datasets are validated and can run their digital workflows. Implementation projects have proven that when data are liberated and integrated appropriately, user capabilities expand.
  - Citations: Caso (2020)

This suggests that power user development is facilitated by data accessibility and quality, with users evolving their capabilities as they gain access to better-organized and more comprehensive data resources.


## System Architecture and User Capability Development


### Scalable and Flexible Architectures

Modern system architectures are designed with user evolution in mind. Data management and archival systems rest upon foundational pillars including robust and stable system architecture necessary to serve as the backbone within a context of constant technological progress and evolving needs of operators and end users. This architectural philosophy acknowledges that user needs evolve over time and that systems must accommodate this evolution.
  - Citations: Owens et al. (2022)

Automation systems that significantly reduce time and costs required to establish infrastructure, making them valuable for small teams and startups, provide high performance and flexibility for long-term operations under high loads. Such systems give users universal and powerful tools that they can grow into over time.
  - Citations: Bolshakov (2025)


### Workflow Improvements and Error Reduction

Research has demonstrated that workflow improvements including automated systems reduce error rates and improve productivity. Version control of software and settings used for data collection has been implemented to manage tracking of changes to algorithms and default experiment settings. These improvements suggest that users develop expertise partly through system-supported learning that reduces errors and increases efficiency over time.
  - Citations: Ward et al. (2025)


## Implications for Understanding Power User Development


### The Role of Training and Support

The literature suggests that comprehensive training for users, along with dedicated technical support, is essential for optimal system use. Future development should focus on integrating advanced analytics features such as predictive modeling and trend analysis to support data-driven strategies. This implies that power user development is not automatic but requires organizational investment in user development.
  - Citations: Bato (2025)


### Organizational and Cultural Factors

The importance of delimiting responsibility centers, predictive planning, the formation of competent teams, and systemic motivation as main principles of effective project management has been emphasized. Modern trends in the development of IT tools that allow automating management processes suggest that power user development occurs within organizational contexts that either support or hinder user evolution.
  - Citations: APPLICATION (2025)

Automation of business processes creates environments where users can focus on developing higher-level skills rather than routine tasks, potentially accelerating their evolution toward power user status.


## Limitations and Research Gaps

The available literature reveals significant gaps in longitudinal research specifically tracing the development of heavy utilization over time in non-social, non-gamified digital tools. While methodologies exist for tracking user behavior changesand systems are designed to accommodate evolving user needs, explicit longitudinal studies documenting the trajectory from novice to power user in productivity software, enterprise systems, or content management platforms remain scarce in the reviewed literature.
  - Citations: Golubev et al. (2017), Owens et al. (2022)

The research that does exist tends to focus on system design and organizational factors rather than individual user development trajectories. Studies of workflow institutionalizationand platform productivity gainsprovide indirect evidence that users evolve over time but do not directly trace individual user journeys.
  - Citations: Maeyer (2019)


## Conclusion

The available evidence, while not providing direct longitudinal studies of power user development, strongly suggests that power users evolve rather than emerge fully formed. This conclusion is supported by several converging lines of evidence: the recognition that user needs evolve over time and systems must accommodate this evolution; the observation that workflow complexity increases over time, requiring corresponding user adaptation; the finding that platform design can accelerate productivity gains; and the acknowledgment that training and support are essential for optimal system use.
  - Citations: Owens et al. (2022), Szatny (2007), Bato (2025)

The methodological infrastructure for studying user behavior evolution exists, including clustering techniques for identifying behavioral changesand context-aware computing approaches. However, the application of these methods to longitudinal studies of power user development in productivity and enterprise software represents an important gap in the current literature that warrants future research attention.

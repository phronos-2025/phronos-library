# Evidence for the Psychological and Behavioral Validity of Semantic Embedding Distances


## Introduction

The question of whether semantic embedding distances—mathematical measures of similarity between vector representations of text—correspond to meaningful psychological and behavioral phenomena represents a critical intersection of computational linguistics, cognitive science, and behavioral research. This synthesis examines the empirical evidence supporting the validity of semantic embeddings as proxies for human cognition and behavior, drawing from studies that have directly tested these relationships across multiple domains.


## Cognitive and Neural Correlates of Semantic Embeddings


### Alignment with Neural Processing

A growing body of research demonstrates that semantic embedding distances correlate with measurable neural and cognitive processes. Contextual embeddings generated by large language models have demonstrated structural similarities to brain activity patterns at the single-word level, supporting theoretical frameworks proposing vector-based neural coding for natural language processing in the brain. This alignment suggests that linguistic units may be represented neurally as context-sensitive vectors analogous to LLM-derived embeddings. Furthermore, research has shown that cumulative distance metrics between contextual embeddings of adjacent linguistic units may quantitatively reflect neural activation intensity during reading comprehension, as measured through EEG datasets collected during reading tasks.

The integration of language model embeddings into cognitive architectures has yielded promising results. Research integrating embedding vectors within the ACT-R cognitive modeling framework has demonstrated a strong correlation between ACT-R predictions and observed human response times from a dataset, providing proof of concept for how embedding vectors can be integrated within algorithmic-level models of language processing. This suggests that the mathematical distances captured by embeddings reflect genuine cognitive processing demands.

### Validation Against Reaction Time Data

Perhaps the most direct evidence for psychological validity comes from studies comparing embedding similarities to human reaction times in controlled experimental paradigms. A comprehensive evaluation framework grounded in cognitive science experimental data compared word pair similarities to reaction times of subjects in large scale lexical decision and naming tasks under semantic priming. The results demonstrated that GloVe embeddings produced significantly higher correlation with experimental measurements than other controlled and off-the-shelf embeddings, suggesting that the mathematical properties of embedding algorithms capture genuine semantic relationships that influence human processing speed.

Additional research has highlighted parallels between language model predictions and human processing, emphasizing the importance of considering contextual constraint effects when studying word prediction in these models and identifying possible parallels with human processing. These parallels suggest that the semantic spaces captured by embeddings reflect cognitive structures that influence behavioral responses.

## Behavioral Prediction from Semantic Embeddings


### Mental Health and Emotional States

Compelling evidence for behavioral validity emerges from research predicting psychological states from semantic content. The DASentimental system achieved state-of-the-art, cross-validated predictions for depression (R = 0.7), anxiety (R = 0.44), and stress (R = 0.52) using semantic embeddings of emotional recall texts. Critically, this research found that semantic distances between recalls were key for estimating depression levels but redundant for anxiety and stress levels, suggesting that semantic embedding distances capture meaningful psychological variation—individuals experiencing depression produce text with distinct semantic organizational patterns that can be quantified through embedding distances.

This finding directly addresses the question of whether users who write semantically similar text behave similarly: the research demonstrates that semantic similarity in written content predicts clinically relevant psychological states, implying that individuals with similar semantic patterns in their writing share similar psychological experiences and, by extension, related behavioral tendencies.


### Cross-Domain Semantic Mappings

Research on cross-domain semantic alignment has examined how people perform semantic mappings and whether embedding-based similarities predict human behavior. Studies have employed various measures—including word-embedding similarity and semantic-differential-based dimensional similarity—as predictors of human convergence rates in cross-domain mapping tasks. These similarities were analyzed using mixed-effects linear regression models, demonstrating that embedding-based measures predict systematic patterns in human semantic judgments.

## Communicative and Linguistic Validity


### Entropy and Communicative Efficiency

The relationship between embedding distances and communicative behavior has been established through information-theoretic approaches. Research has demonstrated that entropy, a measure of unpredictability, is negatively correlated with distance in word embedding spaces, providing a link between semantic embedding distances and communicative efficiency with implications for cognitive processing. This correlation suggests that semantic embedding distances reflect not merely abstract mathematical relationships but functionally relevant properties of language use that influence how efficiently humans communicate.

### Metaphor and Figurative Language Processing

The validity of embeddings extends to complex linguistic phenomena. Research on metaphor comprehension has employed a computational model of semantics to explore whether different mechanisms underlie figurative versus literal statement processing. This approach allows for the quantification of the semantic relationship between keywords in literal and metaphorical statements, demonstrating that embedding distances can capture nuanced semantic relationships that correspond to human comprehension processes.

## Contextual and Social Behavioral Correlates


### Disability and Environmental Context

Research applying word embeddings to understand disability contexts has leveraged the principle that words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings. The World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health conceptualizes disability not solely as a problem that resides in the individual but as a health experience that occurs in a context. By applying word embeddings to Reddit data, researchers have demonstrated that semantic similarities in how people discuss disability-related experiences reflect shared contextual and environmental factors, suggesting that semantic similarity in user-generated text corresponds to similarity in lived experiences and behavioral contexts.

## Limitations and Considerations

While the evidence broadly supports the psychological and behavioral validity of semantic embedding distances, several caveats merit attention. The strength of correlations varies across domains, with depression prediction achieving R = 0.7 while anxiety prediction reached only R = 0.44, suggesting that embedding distances capture some psychological constructs better than others. Additionally, the choice of embedding algorithm significantly influences validity, with GloVe outperforming alternatives in cognitive validation studies. Furthermore, contextual constraint effects must be considered when interpreting embedding-based predictions, as the relationship between semantic distance and behavior may be modulated by situational factors.

## Conclusion

The accumulated evidence provides substantial support for the psychological and behavioral validity of semantic embedding distances. Neural correlates demonstrate alignment between embedding structures and brain activity patterns, while behavioral studies show significant correlations with reaction times, mental health states, and communicative efficiency. The integration of embeddings into cognitive architectures successfully predicts human response times, and cross-domain mapping studies confirm that embedding similarities predict human semantic judgments. Collectively, this evidence suggests that users who produce semantically similar text do indeed share meaningful psychological characteristics and behavioral tendencies, though the strength of this relationship varies by domain and requires careful consideration of algorithmic and contextual factors.

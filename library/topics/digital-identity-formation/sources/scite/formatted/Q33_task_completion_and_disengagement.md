# Task Completion as a Driver of Disengagement from Technology and Information Systems: A Literature Review


## Introduction

The relationship between task completion and user disengagement from technology platforms represents a critical yet underexplored area within information systems research. While substantial literature exists on technology adoption and initial acceptance, the dynamics of what occurs after users successfully achieve their goals—and whether this leads to continued engagement or platform abandonment—remains less systematically examined. This review synthesizes available literature to examine the factors that predict whether users return for new tasks versus disengage entirely following goal attainment.


## Theoretical Foundations: Technology Acceptance and System Success

The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has served as the predominant framework for understanding user interactions with information systems. However, its application has primarily focused on adoption rather than post-completion behavior. Holden and Karshemphasize that "whether an information system is 'successful' or not is decided on the workfloor," highlighting that system success ultimately depends on sustained user engagement rather than mere initial adoption. Their review documents "numerous cases of underuse, resistance, work-arounds and overrides, sabotage, and even abandonment" as evidence that technology acceptance is an ongoing process rather than a single decision point. This observation suggests that task completion may serve as a critical juncture where users reassess their relationship with the technology.

The integration of TAM with usability assessment provides additional insight into post-task behavior. Fidel et al.note that in evaluating technology tools, researchers must "supplement typical usability measures of task completion, efficiency, and perceived satisfaction with an assessment of perceived usefulness and intent to use, consistent with the Technology Acceptance Model." This approach recognizes that task completion alone is insufficient for predicting future engagement; rather, the user's perception of the system's ongoing utility becomes paramount.

## Factors Influencing Continued Engagement Versus Disengagement


### System Quality and Information Quality

Research on e-learning systems provides valuable insights into the factors that sustain user engagement beyond initial task completion. Jaoua et al.validated that three components—system quality, information quality, and service quality—significantly influence continued system use. Their findings indicate that "information quality developed as the most significant contributor in establishing and developing e-learning system...with 0.94, followed by system quality, with 0.92, and, finally, ranked service quality, with 0.79." This hierarchy suggests that users who complete tasks on platforms with high information quality are more likely to return for subsequent tasks, as the perceived value of the information resource extends beyond any single goal.

### Perceived Usefulness and Behavioral Intention

The behavioral model proposed by Chin and Lindemonstrates that external factors influence users' behavioral intention through "expected satisfaction, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness." Their structural equation modeling approach reveals that compatibility, features, technology complexity, and perceived risk serve as external variables that shape ongoing engagement decisions. This framework implies that task completion satisfaction alone does not determine return behavior; rather, users evaluate whether the platform's characteristics align with anticipated future needs.
  - Citations: Chin (2016)

Liuextends this analysis by noting that "understanding information technology and its related products and services is increasingly important because the everyday use of technology continues to expand and broaden." They further indicate that existing theories that explore the dominant factors driving intention to use a new technology are limited, particularly regarding post-adoption continuance decisions. This gap in the literature underscores the need for more focused investigation of task completion as a transition point in user engagement.


### Self-Regulation and Goal-Related Behavior

The self-regulated learning literature offers relevant insights into how goal achievement affects subsequent behavior. Sitzmann and Elyconducted a comprehensive meta-analysis and found that "goal level, persistence, effort, and self-efficacy were the self-regulation constructs with the strongest effects on learning." Critically, these constructs "accounted for 17% of the variance in learning, after controlling for cognitive ability and pretraining knowledge." This suggests that users with higher self-efficacy following task completion may be more likely to set new goals within the same platform, while those with lower self-efficacy may disengage.
  - Citations: Sitzmann (2011)

Nicholls et al.provide a complementary perspective from sports psychology, noting that "goal disengagement may have been negatively linked to poorer well-being." Their research found "a negative association between disengagement-oriented coping and goal attainment," suggesting that the quality of task completion—not merely its occurrence—influences subsequent engagement patterns. Users who complete tasks successfully with positive affective outcomes may be predisposed to return, while those who complete tasks with difficulty or dissatisfaction may disengage.

## Early Detection of Disengagement

Research on intelligent tutoring systems has begun to address the prediction of disengagement during task engagement. Boote et al.describe methods for predicting whether the student will complete the current activity or disengage from it. They note that "training a disengagement predictor is useful not only in itself but also in identifying visual indicators of negative affective states even when they don't lead to non-completion of the task." This research suggests that disengagement signals may be detectable before task completion, potentially allowing for interventions that could influence post-completion return behavior.
  - Citations: Boote et al. (2021)

The distinction between task non-completion and post-completion disengagement is significant. Boote et al.focus on preventing disengagement during tasks, but their methodology—using visual features to detect "early warning signs of disengagement in time to prevent it"—could theoretically be extended to predict post-completion platform abandonment.

## Organizational and Contextual Factors


### HR Technology and Organizational Satisfaction

Florkowskiexamines macro-level factors influencing technology system performance, specifically assessing "the relative contribution that HRT goal realization makes to organizational satisfaction with HR services." Using structural equation modeling, this research tested "the roles that organizational support, capabilities and aspects of the environment play in technology goal attainment and collective satisfaction with HR services." The findings suggest that goal realization within technology systems contributes to broader satisfaction, which may in turn influence continued platform engagement.
  - Citations: Florkowski (2020)

Haines and Lafleursimilarly document that "the human resource function has undergone dramatic change, owing, it would seem, to greater use of rapidly evolving information technology." Their investigation found "relationships between information technology use and greater involvement in the strategic HR roles of business partner and change agent." This suggests that successful task completion that enables role expansion may drive continued engagement, while task completion that does not enhance user capabilities may lead to disengagement.
  - Citations: Haines (2008)


### Digital Competencies and Engagement

Bećirović et al.explore the relationship between internet habits, self-efficacy, and academic achievement, finding that "more internet use leads to higher technological competence, thus potentially influencing academic engagement as well as achievement in technology-augmented learning environments." Their research suggests that to improve users' continued engagement, they should be provided access to complementary digital technology sessions and materials, which would also induce and regulate their learning outcomes in the future.
  - Citations: Be (2025)

Avsec et al.further demonstrate that "ICT self-concept related to problem solving and cognitive engagement mediates the relationship between systems thinking and design course achievement." Their study highlights the importance of leveraging learning system dynamics factors, suggesting that platforms enabling cognitive engagement and problem-solving skill development may foster return visits following task completion.
  - Citations: Avsec et al. (2023)


## Implications for Platform Design and User Retention


### Feedback Environment and Goal Orientation

Zhang et al.investigate "the impact of individual learning goal orientation and the digital feedback environment on individuals' feedback-seeking behaviors." Their findings demonstrate that "both the digital feedback environment and learning goal orientation can promote individual inquiry." This research suggests that platforms providing robust feedback mechanisms following task completion may encourage users to set new goals and return, rather than disengaging after achieving their initial objective.
  - Citations: Zhang et al. (2022)


### Multimodal Assessment of Self-Regulated Learning

Bernacki et al.address the challenge of understanding user behavior in technology-based learning environments, noting that users "must self-regulate their learning (self-regulated learning SRL) by appraising tasks, making plans, setting goals, and enacting and monitoring strategies." Their research provides methodological approaches for understanding the transition from task completion to subsequent engagement decisions by analyzing digital event data when learners engage with technology-based tools.

## Gaps in Current Literature

The reviewed literature reveals several significant gaps regarding task completion as a driver of disengagement:

Limited post-completion focus: Most research examines adoption, initial use, or within-task engagement rather than the critical transition point following goal achievement,,.
  - Citations: Holden (2010), Fidel et al. (2024)

Insufficient longitudinal analysis: Studies typically assess single-session behavior rather than tracking users across multiple task completion cycles to understand return patterns,.
  - Citations: Sitzmann (2011), Jaoua et al. (2022)

Underexplored affective factors: While Nicholls et al.and Boote et al.address emotional states, the specific affective experience of task completion and its influence on return behavior remains understudied.
  - Citations: Nicholls et al. (2016), Boote et al. (2021)

Platform-specific versus generalizable findings: Much research focuses on specific contexts (e-learning, HR systems) without establishing generalizable principles for task completion-driven disengagement,,.

## Conclusion

The literature on task completion as a driver of disengagement from technology and information systems remains fragmented across multiple disciplines and research traditions. Evidence suggests that several factors predict whether users return for new tasks versus leave platforms entirely following goal achievement: system and information quality, perceived usefulness and behavioral intention,, self-efficacy and goal-related self-regulation,, organizational support and role enhancement,, and digital competency development,. The quality of the task completion experience—not merely its occurrence—appears to significantly influence subsequent engagement decisions,.

Future research should specifically examine the transition point following task completion, employing longitudinal designs that track users across multiple goal cycles. Additionally, the development of predictive models for post-completion disengagement, building on early detection work by Boote et al., represents a promising direction for both theoretical advancement and practical platform design.

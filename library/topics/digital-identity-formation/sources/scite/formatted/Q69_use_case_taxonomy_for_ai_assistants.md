## Taxonomies of AI Conversational Agent Types


### Fundamental Categorizations of Dialogue Systems

Researchers have established foundational taxonomies that distinguish between different types of conversational AI systems based on their primary functions. The neural models in conversational AI can be broadly divided into three fundamental categories: open-domain chatbots, knowledge-grounded dialogue agents, and task-oriented dialogue systems. This tripartite classification reflects the distinct purposes these systems serve—from casual conversation to information retrieval to completing specific user tasks.
  - Citations: Bao et al. (2021)

Building upon this foundation, existing works on dialogue systems are primarily divided into two overarching categories: retrieval-based methods and generative approaches. Task-oriented dialogue systems specifically focus on conversations with artificial agents aimed at completing concrete tasks, though such systems are currently limited to a few narrow domains. This limitation has driven research into expanding the scope and capabilities of conversational agents across multiple application areas.
  - Citations: Ma et al. (2019), Razumovskaia et al. (2021)

The distinction between task-oriented and non-task-oriented systems represents a fundamental taxonomic division in the field. Conversational agents can be categorized into task-oriented dialogue systems designed for specific goal completion and non-task-oriented chatbot systems intended for more general conversational engagement. This categorization helps researchers and practitioners understand the design requirements and evaluation criteria appropriate for different system types.

This work examines expression and creativity-based systems where the AI attempts to model user intentions and respond appropriately, contributing to our understanding of how interaction intent taxonomies should account for social and emotional dimensions of communication.
  - Citations: Feldman et al. (2017)

The participatory prompting method represents one approach to understanding human-AI interaction workflows. In this framework, participants express their intent, researchers formulate prompts based on this intent and pre-prepared prompting strategies, and enter the prompt into the AI system. This mediated approach to intent expression highlights the complexity of mapping user intentions to system inputs.
  - Citations: Drosos et al. (2024)

Studies of chatbot-mediated communication have examined how systems display communication immediacy techniques while responding to users at any time. The ability to have private conversations with chatbots enables users to focus their attention and ask more questions, revealing patterns in how users structure their interaction intents over multiple conversational turns.
  - Citations: Jasin et al. (2023)


### Behavioral and Psychological Dimensions of Interaction

Research has identified psychological factors that influence how users interact with AI assistants and express their intents. Perceived empathy strongly predicts consumer trust, and empathetic language triggers engagement during chatbot interactions. These findings suggest that taxonomies of human-AI interaction must account for affective dimensions beyond purely functional intent categories.
  - Citations: Muliansyah (2024)

Studies have shown that many users may be reticent to utilize AI-enabled technologies in healthcare contexts due to concerns about accuracy, cybersecurity, and the inability of AI-led services to empathize or deal with severe illness. This research indicates that user intent and willingness to engage with AI assistants varies significantly based on the perceived capabilities and limitations of the system.
  - Citations: Gbollie et al. (2023)

Patients frequently describe AI systems as "judgment-free" and supportive, which enhances openness and engagement, particularly in sensitive contexts such as health behavior change interventions. This perception influences how users formulate and express their interaction intents, suggesting that the social framing of AI assistants affects the types of queries and requests users are willing to make.

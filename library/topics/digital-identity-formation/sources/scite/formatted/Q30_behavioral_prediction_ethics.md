# Ethical Frameworks and Guidelines for Presenting Behavioral Predictions Without Implying Causation or Prescription


## Introduction

The presentation of behavioral predictions to individuals represents a significant ethical challenge in contemporary research and practice, particularly as machine learning and artificial intelligence increasingly enable sophisticated predictive modeling of human behavior. A fundamental tension exists between the utility of behavioral predictions and the risk of misinterpretation, where correlational findings may be erroneously understood as causal relationships or prescriptive guidance. This challenge is compounded by the recognition that "correlation does not imply causation", yet recommendations for policy and interventions that rely on causal assumptions are often formulated in discussion sections of research. This synthesis examines the existing ethical frameworks and guidelines that address how behavioral predictions should be communicated to individuals while avoiding implications of causation or prescription.

## The Causation-Correlation Distinction in Behavioral Prediction


### Fundamental Epistemological Challenges

The distinction between correlation and causation represents a foundational concern in presenting behavioral predictions. As Cauwenberg et al. emphasize, early scientific training instills the principle that correlation does not imply causation, and quasi-experimental and observational studies cannot prove causation. Consequently, in non-randomized studies, causal language is purposefully avoided when formulating study aims. However, this creates a paradox: while researchers avoid causal language in their methods and results, they often formulate recommendations for policy and future interventions in discussion sections that inherently rely on causal assumptions.

This epistemological challenge is particularly acute in predictive modeling contexts. Deep learning approaches have delivered substantial gains in prediction; however, purely predictive models risk conflating correlation with causation when used to inform interventions. This conflation becomes especially problematic when predictions are communicated to individuals who may interpret predictive relationships as deterministic or prescriptive.

### Evidence from Pandemic-Related Research

Recent research on trust in science and pandemic-related behaviors illustrates the dangers of assuming causal effects from correlational predictions. While trust in science predicts health-related protection intentions and behaviors such as social distancing and vaccination, many researchers and policymakers have erroneously believed that interventions targeting trust in science would be key for curbing the spread of future pandemics. This represents a case where correlational predictions were inappropriately interpreted as implying causal mechanisms that could guide prescriptive interventions.

## Ethical Frameworks for Digital Phenotyping and Behavioral Prediction


### Mental Health Applications

Digital phenotyping tools, which can be used to study and predict behavior, present significant ethical concerns that have prompted the development of specific ethical frameworks. Martinez-Martin et al. conducted a Delphi study to establish ethical guidelines for digital phenotyping tools in mental health applications. These tools are of increasing interest for consumer, government, and healthcare applications, with expectations that they will improve mental health diagnoses and treatment. However, the ethical framework developed through this research identifies significant areas of concern, particularly regarding privacy and data protection, consent, bias, and accountability.
  - Citations: Martinez (2021)

The ethical development framework for digital phenotyping emphasizes that predictions about behavior must be communicated in ways that respect individual autonomy and do not imply deterministic outcomes. This is particularly important in mental health contexts where predictions about behavior could stigmatize individuals or lead to inappropriate interventions.

## Artificial Intelligence Guidelines and Standard Frameworks


### Medical AI Implementation

The integration of AI into clinical settings has necessitated the development of robust guidelines and standard frameworks that consider the evolving challenges of AI implementation. Shiferaw et al. conducted a systematic review evaluating guidelines quality and summarizing ethical frameworks, best practices, and recommendations for AI in medicine. These guidelines address how AI-generated predictions, including behavioral predictions, should be presented to both clinicians and patients.
  - Citations: Shiferaw et al. (2024)

A critical finding from implementation research is that despite recognition of the importance and challenges of AI implementation, many frameworks have not adequately referenced existing implementation literature. This gap is significant because there is a wealth of literature on implementation challenges and facilitators that could inform how predictions are communicated. The failure to integrate this knowledge may result in predictions being presented without appropriate contextual framing that would prevent causal or prescriptive misinterpretation.

### Context-Aware Personalization Frameworks

Ethical frameworks for context-aware personalization systems provide guidance on presenting behavioral predictions while preserving privacy and avoiding inappropriate implications. Oguntola and Simske describe a systems engineering framework where the persona generator leverages unsupervised machine learning to assign users into cohorts and learn cohort behaviors while preserving privacy within an ethical framework. This approach emphasizes that predictions about user behavior and intent should be presented within appropriate ethical boundaries that do not imply deterministic causation.

## Beneficence and Nonmaleficence in Behavioral Prediction


### Ethical Principles in Practice

The principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence provide foundational ethical guidance for presenting behavioral predictions. Research on police-led jail diversion programs demonstrates how ethically grounded frameworks can guide practice even when resource constraints and variability in system coordination create challenges. Strengthening partnerships between professionals and community organizations can enhance the ethical presentation of behavioral predictions by ensuring multiple perspectives inform how predictions are communicated.
  - Citations: Petreca et al. (2025)

However, societal ambivalence about certain conditions, expectations of personal accountability, and discomfort with mandated treatment can complicate efforts to implement practices aligned with beneficence and nonmaleficence. This suggests that ethical frameworks must account for broader social contexts when determining how behavioral predictions should be presented to individuals.

## Challenges in Behavioral Analytics and Transparency


### Data Privacy and Ethical Governance

Behavioral analytics enabled by machine learning and predictive modeling facilitates granular insights into decision-making, yet often raises concerns related to data privacy, manipulation, and ethical governance. These concerns are directly relevant to how predictions are presented to individuals, as the manner of presentation can itself constitute a form of manipulation if it implies causation or prescription without adequate justification.
  - Citations: Pasupuleti (2024)

The intersection of behavioral analytics and transparency requirements suggests that ethical frameworks must address not only what predictions are made but how they are communicated. Trust-centric business models require that predictions be presented in ways that maintain transparency about their correlational rather than causal nature.
  - Citations: Pasupuleti (2024)


### Resocialization and Individual Prediction

The use of digital technologies for individual prediction of behavior raises particularly acute ethical concerns. Research on predicting the behavior of convicts emphasizes that such predictions must be carefully considered in the context of legal and ethical standards. The use of prediction technologies is controversial and requires careful ethical consideration to ensure that predictions are not presented in ways that imply deterministic outcomes or prescribe specific interventions without appropriate justification.
  - Citations: Mukanov et al. (2025)


## Big Data and Communication Challenges


### New Ethical Problems in Data-Driven Prediction

The development of big data has created ethical questions that are difficult to solve as they imply new challenges that did not arise before. Some of these challenges are related to communication issues, requiring that patients and citizens understand new ethical problems associated with behavioral prediction. Others relate to the way in which researchers can store, analyze, and distribute information, and some relate to the limits on which technologies are ethically safe and which bring erosion of basic human rights.
  - Citations: C (2020)

The capacity of medical data to predict and transform human behavior creates particular ethical obligations regarding how predictions are communicated. Ethical frameworks must address not only the technical aspects of prediction but also the communicative practices through which predictions are shared with individuals.
  - Citations: C (2020)


## Methodological Frameworks for Avoiding Causal Misinterpretation


### Directed Acyclic Graphs and Causal Thinking

Cauwenberg et al. advocate for embracing causal thinking using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) as a methodological framework that can help clarify when causal claims are and are not justified. This approach provides a systematic method for distinguishing between correlational predictions and causal relationships, which can inform how predictions are presented to individuals.
  - Citations: Cauwenberg et al. (2023)

By making causal assumptions explicit through graphical models, researchers and practitioners can more clearly communicate the limitations of behavioral predictions and avoid implying causation where only correlation has been established. This methodological transparency supports ethical communication practices.
  - Citations: Cauwenberg et al. (2023)


### Causal Inference in Predictive Modeling

The integration of causal inference methods with predictive modeling offers a framework for addressing counterfactual questions required for causal decision-making. However, this integration also highlights the distinction between prediction and causation: purely predictive models cannot answer causal questions about what would happen under different interventions. Ethical presentation of predictions requires acknowledging this limitation explicitly.
  - Citations: Ogundipe (2025)


## Normative Ethical Theories and Their Application


### Philosophical Foundations

Normative ethical theories provide foundational frameworks for considering how behavioral predictions should be presented. These theories can be divided into consequential theories dealing exclusively with the consequences of an action, single-rule nonconsequential theories dealing with principles such as the golden rule and Kant's categorical imperative, and multiple-rule nonconsequential theories. Each of these frameworks offers different guidance on the ethics of presenting predictions.
  - Citations: Tsalikis (2018)

From a consequentialist perspective, the ethical presentation of predictions depends on the outcomes of that presentation—whether it leads to beneficial or harmful consequences for the individual. Deontological frameworks would emphasize duties of honesty and respect for autonomy, requiring that predictions be presented without misleading implications about causation or prescription.
  - Citations: Tsalikis (2018)


## Recommendations and Best Practices


### Framework Integration

Effective ethical frameworks for presenting behavioral predictions must integrate multiple considerations. First, they must acknowledge the fundamental distinction between correlation and causation, ensuring that predictive relationships are not presented as causal mechanisms. Second, they must address privacy and data protection concerns, particularly when predictions are derived from sensitive behavioral data. Third, they must respect individual autonomy by avoiding prescriptive implications that could unduly influence individual decision-making.
  - Citations: Cauwenberg et al. (2023), Martinez (2021)


### Communication Standards

Ethical guidelines should establish clear communication standards that require explicit acknowledgment of the correlational nature of predictions. These standards should address how uncertainty is communicated, ensuring that individuals understand the probabilistic rather than deterministic nature of behavioral predictions. Additionally, guidelines should specify how predictions should be contextualized within broader information about the limitations of predictive models.
  - Citations: Cauwenberg et al. (2023), Shiferaw et al. (2024), Gama et al. (2022)


## Conclusion

The ethical presentation of behavioral predictions to individuals without implying causation or prescription requires integration of multiple frameworks and guidelines. Digital phenotyping ethics emphasize privacy, consent, bias, and accountability. AI implementation guidelines stress the importance of robust frameworks that consider evolving challenges. Foundational ethical principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence provide guidance on avoiding harm through inappropriate presentation of predictions. Methodological frameworks such as DAGs offer tools for clarifying causal assumptions. Together, these frameworks suggest that ethical presentation of behavioral predictions requires explicit acknowledgment of correlational limitations, transparent communication of uncertainty, respect for individual autonomy, and careful attention to the potential for misinterpretation. The challenge of presenting predictions without implying causation or prescription remains significant, but existing frameworks provide substantial guidance for addressing this challenge in research and practice.

# Semantic-Behavioral Coupling in User Trajectories: Do Users with Similar First Prompts Exhibit Similar Subsequent Behavior?


## Abstract

This systematic review examines whether users who begin their interactions with semantically similar first prompts demonstrate comparable subsequent behavioral patterns in productivity software, enterprise systems, and content management platforms. The analysis synthesizes available evidence on semantic similarity measurement, user behavior modeling, and the coupling between initial semantic positioning and behavioral trajectories in non-social, non-gamified digital environments.


## 1. Introduction

Understanding the relationship between users' initial semantic positioning and their subsequent behavioral trajectories represents a critical challenge for enterprise software design, content management systems, and productivity platforms. The fundamental question—whether users who enter a system with semantically similar first prompts exhibit similar subsequent behaviors—has significant implications for personalization, user experience optimization, and system design.

Semantic similarity has been extensively studied across multiple domains, with researchers developing various computational approaches to measure the relatedness between textual inputs. These methods can be classified into distinct categories, including methods based on semantic distance and methods based on information content. The application of such measures to predict user behavior, however, remains an emerging area of inquiry, particularly in enterprise and productivity contexts.

The challenge of understanding semantic-behavioral coupling is compounded by the complexity of user behavior in digital systems. As noted in research on enterprise systems, learning processes in work environments are "substantially social, where users learn much from each other in creatively fashioning new routines". This suggests that behavioral trajectories may be influenced not solely by initial semantic positioning but by social and contextual factors within the system environment.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations of Semantic Similarity and User Behavior


### 2.1 Semantic Similarity Measurement Approaches

The measurement of semantic similarity between user inputs establishes the groundwork for any analysis of semantic neighborhoods. Research has identified multiple approaches to calculating semantic similarity, with edge-based measures representing one of the primary methodological traditions. These approaches quantify semantic distance based on relationships within structured knowledge representations.
  - Citations: Pesquita et al. (2008)

Research has established that existing approaches can be organized into distinct categories, such as "methods based on semantic distance, methods based on information content" and various hybrid formulations. This taxonomic understanding is essential for operationalizing "semantic neighborhoods" in user behavior research. The selection of an appropriate similarity measure significantly impacts identifying users who share similar initial prompts.
  - Citations: Gan et al. (2013)

In the context of recommendation systems and user behavior analysis, semantic similarity algorithms analyze "users' historical behaviors and preferences" to recommend content that aligns with user interests. This application showcases the practical utility of semantic similarity measures in understanding and predicting user behavior patterns. Furthermore, research indicates that semantic similarity can be integrated with collaborative filtering approaches to generate more accurate recommendations.
  - Citations: Liu (2023), Wu et al. (2010)


### 2.2 Semantic Features in User Modeling

Incorporating semantic features into user models has proven valuable for understanding behavioral patterns. Research on affective analysis suggests that "semantic features have also been employed in affective models" for analyzing user-created content. This indicates that the semantic characteristics of user inputs carry meaningful information about user states and potential behavioral tendencies.
  - Citations: Palogiannidi et al. (2015)

Studies examining the relationship between semantic similarity and social proximity reveal that "strong correlations exist between annotations and social proximity". Although this finding arises from social network contexts, it suggests a broader principle: semantic alignment between users may predict behavioral alignment. In folksonomy-based systems, researchers have shown that "a substantial level of local lexical and topical alignment is observable" among users who are closely linked in the social network.
  - Citations: Chelmis (2012), Schifanella (2010)

Research indicates that such semantic similarity "does not appear to develop during community evolution, but is rather the result of a pre-existing shared background between users". This finding has profound implications for the semantic-behavioral coupling question, suggesting that users who begin with similar semantic inputs may share underlying characteristics that predispose them toward similar behavioral trajectories.
  - Citations: Capocci et al. (2010)


## 3. User Behavior Trajectories in Enterprise and Productivity Systems


### 3.1 Enterprise System Adoption and Learning Patterns

The adoption and use of enterprise systems involve complex learning processes shaping user behavior trajectories. Research demonstrates that "a new work system must be built around the use of the enterprise software and that such a learning process will be substantially social". This perspective emphasizes that behavioral trajectories in enterprise contexts are not purely individual phenomena; they emerge through interaction with the system and other users.
  - Citations: Yamauchi (2010)

The concept of "familiarity pockets" describes how users develop localized expertise within enterprise systems. This suggests that users may cluster into behavioral groups based on specific system features and workflows they master, potentially creating behavioral neighborhoods paralleling semantic neighborhoods.
  - Citations: Yamauchi (2010)

Enterprise software adoption research has examined the usage patterns of major applications, including ERP, SCM, and CRM systems, categorizing usage levels as "none, minor, or broad". This categorical approach to measuring enterprise software engagement provides a framework for understanding behavioral trajectories, though it may not fully capture the nuanced patterns emerging from semantic analysis of user interactions.


### 3.2 Content Management and Knowledge Systems

In content management and knowledge-based systems, user behavior is shaped by both the semantic structure of content and the tools available for interaction. Research on the semantic enhancement of learning object repositories demonstrates how "tag-based annotations and the accuracy of structured formal annotations" can be combined to improve user experience. This integration reflects the dual nature of user behavior in content systems.
  - Citations: Pe (2013)

Knowledge sharing behavior in online forums has been studied across multiple dimensions, including "semantic similarity (SS), social intimacy and popularity (SIP), and profession and reliability (PR)". This multi-dimensional approach to understanding user behavior suggests that semantic similarity alone may not fully predict behavioral trajectories but rather interact with social and professional factors.
  - Citations: Li et al. (2012)

The development of knowledge-based user interfaces for e-learning systems illustrates how semantic technologies can be integrated with enterprise resource planning and content management software "to ensure meaningful search and retrieval of expertise". Such systems create environments where user behavior is guided by semantic structures, potentially strengthening the coupling between initial semantic positioning and subsequent behavior.
  - Citations: Fazlollahtabar (2012)


### 3.3 Digital Capability and User Adaptation

Research on digital transformation in manufacturing enterprises notes that "the widespread use of digital technology has enabled user participation in corporate innovation, and changes in user behavior have required companies to adapt to new business rules". This bidirectional relationship between technology and behavior suggests that semantic-behavioral coupling may evolve as systems and users co-adapt.
  - Citations: Li (2023)

The diffusion and application of digital technologies are described as being "influenced by people's behaviors and attitudes toward digitalization". This observation implies that users' initial orientations—potentially reflected in their first semantic inputs—may shape their subsequent engagement patterns with digital tools.
  - Citations: Li (2023)


## 4. Evidence for Semantic-Behavioral Coupling


### 4.1 Semantic Neighborhoods and Behavioral Prediction

The question of whether semantic neighborhoods predict behavioral similarity has been addressed indirectly through user modeling and recommendation systems research. Studies on cyber-physical behavior prediction have "employed users' cyber-physical semantic similarity for future location prediction", demonstrating that semantic similarity measures can predict subsequent user actions.
  - Citations: Kaur et al. (2020)

Research on cascade dynamics in information systems has examined "when and which users" will engage with content. While this work primarily focuses on social media contexts rather than enterprise systems, the methodological approaches developed for predicting user engagement based on semantic and network features may also apply to productivity software contexts.
  - Citations: Wu et al. (2015)

The integration of semantic similarity with collaborative filtering for personalized web service selection demonstrates how semantic neighborhoods can inform behavioral predictions in business process contexts. This research shows that "collaborative filtering exploits the known preferences of a group of users to formulate recommendations or predictions" of unknown preferences for other users, suggesting that users with similar semantic profiles may exhibit similar behavioral patterns.
  - Citations: Margaris et al. (2015)


### 4.2 Role Emergence and Behavioral Clustering

Research on user roles in online platforms provides evidence for behavioral clustering that may relate to semantic positioning. Studies of discussion forums in MOOCs have analyzed "specific connection patterns that appear in the information exchange networks of forum users" to characterize user roles. These roles emerge from behavioral patterns and may correlate with the semantic content of user contributions.
  - Citations: Hecking et al. (2017)

A comprehensive survey of user role identification on crowdsourced platforms examines whether "different users focus on different kinds of activities and play specific roles". This research spans multiple platforms, providing evidence that users naturally cluster into behavioral categories that may be predicted by their initial engagement patterns.
  - Citations: Saxena (2021)

The identification of spammers versus genuine users in social networks has been approached through analysis of "common shared interests over multiple shared topics between the two users". While focused on spam detection, this research demonstrates that semantic similarity in user interests can predict behavioral differences, supporting the hypothesis of semantic-behavioral coupling.
  - Citations: Koggalahewa et al. (2021)


### 4.3 Limitations of Current Evidence

Despite suggestive findings, direct evidence for semantic-behavioral coupling in productivity software and enterprise systems remains limited. Much existing research focuses on social media platforms, which differ substantially from the non-social, non-gamified tools specified in the research question.

Research on enterprise collaboration systems acknowledges that adoption "often requires a planned approach to managing change", suggesting that behavioral trajectories in enterprise settings may be more strongly influenced by organizational factors than by individual semantic positioning.
  - Citations: Greeven (2022)

Moreover, studies comparing self-report and observational measures of behavior note that "social scientists continue to rely on self-reports for measuring behavior despite ongoing criticism concerning informant inaccuracy". This methodological challenge affects the reliability of behavioral trajectory data and complicates efforts to establish semantic-behavioral coupling.
  - Citations: Shaver et al. (2021)


## 5. Mechanisms of Semantic-Behavioral Coupling


### 5.1 Pre-existing User Characteristics

One mechanism explaining semantic-behavioral coupling is the role of pre-existing user characteristics. Research on folksonomy systems found that semantic similarity between users "does not appear to develop during community evolution but is rather the result of a pre-existing shared background between users". This suggests that users producing semantically similar first prompts may share underlying knowledge, expertise, or cognitive styles that also influence their subsequent behavior.
  - Citations: Capocci et al. (2010)

The concept of "peer acceptance" based on "common shared interests over multiple shared topics"provides a framework for understanding how semantic similarity reflects deeper user characteristics. Users sharing semantic neighborhoods may possess similar professional backgrounds, domain expertise, or problem-solving approaches manifesting in their initial inputs and behavioral trajectories.
  - Citations: Koggalahewa et al. (2021)


### 5.2 System Design and Affordances

The design of productivity software and enterprise systems may strengthen or weaken semantic-behavioral coupling. Research on gamification in software engineering notes the "difficulty of creating an integrated gamified environment comprising all the tools of an organization", highlighting how system fragmentation may disrupt behavioral patterns.
  - Citations: Pedreira et al. (2020)

Studies on users' conception of system purpose demonstrate that "how user's conception of a system's purpose affects their experience and use". This finding suggests that users who frame their initial interactions similarly (reflected in semantic similarity of first prompts) may develop similar mental models of the system, leading to convergent behavioral trajectories.
  - Citations: K (2019)

The integration of semantic technologies with enterprise systems, as shown in research on "semantic social bookmarking platforms" for business intelligence, creates environments where semantic inputs directly shape available actions and recommendations, potentially tightening semantic-behavioral coupling.
  - Citations: Buffa et al. (2013)


### 5.3 Feedback and Adaptation Processes

User behavior trajectories are shaped by feedback processes that may either reinforce or disrupt initial semantic positioning. Research on creative problem solving found that "the first feedback from clients also enhances information content and leads to a divergence of successful ideas". This suggests that early feedback may cause behavioral trajectories to diverge even among users who began in similar semantic neighborhoods.
  - Citations: Georgiev (2018)

Recommendation systems utilizing semantic similarity to suggest content may create feedback loops reinforcing initial semantic positioning. When systems recommend content that "better matches users' interests" based on semantic analysis, users may be guided toward behavioral patterns consistent with their initial semantic profile.
  - Citations: Liu (2023)


## 6. Methodological Considerations for Studying Semantic-Behavioral Coupling


### 6.1 Measuring Semantic Similarity

Operationalizing semantic neighborhoods requires careful selection of similarity measures. Research has demonstrated that different semantic similarity measures perform variably depending on the application context. For user behavior research, measures must be sensitive to the specific semantic dimensions relevant to the productivity or enterprise domain.
  - Citations: Yu et al. (2010)

Advances in large language models have created new possibilities for measuring semantic similarity. Research using GPT-4 has shown that these models can "construct measures of semantic similarity that match human judgment", potentially providing more nuanced assessments of semantic neighborhoods than traditional computational approaches.
  - Citations: Mens et al. (2023)

The choice between edge-based measures, information content measures, and hybrid approachesshould be guided by the specific characteristics of the user input data and the behavioral outcomes of interest.
  - Citations: Gan et al. (2013)


### 6.2 Tracking Behavioral Trajectories

Measuring behavioral trajectories in productivity software and enterprise systems presents significant challenges. Unlike social media platforms, where engagement metrics are readily available, enterprise systems may require specialized instrumentation to capture user behavior patterns.

Research on service behavior mining demonstrates approaches for "deriving service models from recorded interactions", which may be applicable to tracking user behavior in enterprise contexts. These approaches can capture the sequence and timing of user actions, enabling analysis of behavioral trajectories.
  - Citations: Hossain (2025)

The distinction between explicit and implicit feedback is crucial for understanding behavioral trajectories. Research on course recommendation systems notes the value of utilizing "both explicit and implicit feedback to infer learner's preference", suggesting comprehensive behavioral tracking should capture both deliberate user actions and passive engagement patterns.
  - Citations: Xu (2020)


### 6.3 Establishing Coupling Strength

Quantifying the "tightness" of semantic-behavioral coupling requires appropriate statistical and analytical frameworks. Research on semantic similarity in biological contexts has developed methods for "measuring semantic similarity among GO terms and gene products"that may inform approaches to measuring coupling in user behavior contexts.
  - Citations: Yu et al. (2010)

Using null models, as demonstrated in research on folksonomy systems, offers a rigorous approach to establishing whether observed correlations exceed chance expectations. Researchers have introduced "a null model that preserves user activity while removing local correlations, allowing us to disentangle the actual local alignment between users from statistical effects".
  - Citations: Schifanella (2010)


## 7. Implications for System Design


### 7.1 Personalization and Onboarding

Understanding semantic-behavioral coupling has direct implications for system personalization. If users in similar semantic neighborhoods exhibit similar subsequent behavior, systems can leverage initial prompts to predict user needs and customize the experience accordingly.

Research on knowledge-based user interfaces demonstrates how semantic analysis can be employed "to optimize curriculum utility", suggesting similar approaches could optimize user journeys in productivity software based on initial semantic positioning.
  - Citations: Fazlollahtabar (2012)

The finding that semantic similarity may reflect "pre-existing shared backgrounds between users"suggests that onboarding processes could be tailored based on the semantic characteristics of users' first interactions, potentially accelerating time-to-productivity.
  - Citations: Capocci et al. (2010)


### 7.2 User Support and Intervention

If semantic-behavioral coupling is strong, systems could identify users at risk of suboptimal behavioral trajectories based on their initial semantic positioning. Research on identifying "at-risk students" through behavioral analysisprovides models for early intervention that could be adapted to enterprise contexts.
  - Citations: Ntokos (2019)

Integrating semantic analysis with behavioral prediction could enable proactive support, guiding users toward more effective usage patterns before problematic behaviors become entrenched.


### 7.3 System Evolution and Adaptation

Understanding how semantic neighborhoods relate to behavioral patterns can inform system evolution. Research on digital transformation emphasizes that "changes in user behavior have required companies to adapt to new business rules", suggesting that tracking semantic-behavioral relationships over time could guide system development priorities.
  - Citations: Li (2023)


## 8. Gaps in Current Research and Future Directions


### 8.1 Limited Focus on Non-Social, Non-Gamified Systems

Existing literature on semantic-behavioral coupling is heavily weighted toward social media and gamified platforms. Research on gamification in education,and software engineeringprovides insights into engagement patterns but may not generalize to non-gamified productivity tools.
  - Citations: Adewojo (2025), Villarroel et al. (2021), Pedreira et al. (2020)

Enterprise systems research has examined adoption and usage patterns,but has not systematically investigated the relationship between semantic characteristics of initial user inputs and subsequent behavioral trajectories.
  - Citations: Yamauchi (2010)


### 8.2 Need for Longitudinal Studies

Most existing research captures user behavior at single time points or over short periods. Understanding semantic-behavioral coupling requires longitudinal studies tracking users from their first interactions through extended usage periods.

Research on cascade dynamics has examined temporal patterns of user engagement, but has not systematically applied similar approaches to productivity software and enterprise systems.
  - Citations: Wu et al. (2015)


### 8.3 Cross-Platform Comparisons

The strength of semantic-behavioral coupling may vary across different types of systems. Comparative research across productivity software, enterprise systems, and content management platforms would help identify factors that strengthen or weaken this coupling.


## 9. Conclusion

The question of whether users in the same semantic neighborhood exhibit similar subsequent behavior remains incompletely answered, particularly for productivity software, enterprise systems, and content management platforms. Available evidence suggests several important findings:

First, semantic similarity measures provide robust tools for identifying users with similar initial inputs, with multiple methodological approaches available depending on the specific context,,. Second, research on folksonomy and social systems indicates that semantic similarity between users often reflects "pre-existing shared backgrounds" rather than emergent alignment, suggesting that semantic neighborhoods may indeed predict behavioral similarity.
  - Citations: Gan et al. (2013), Pesquita et al. (2008), Wu et al. (2010), Capocci et al. (2010)

Third, the strength of semantic-behavioral coupling likely depends on system design factors, including how semantic inputs shape available actions and recommendations,. Fourth, methodological challenges in measuring both semantic similarity and behavioral trajectories limit current understanding, particularly in enterprise contexts where behavioral data may be less accessible than in social media environments.
  - Citations: Buffa et al. (2013), Fazlollahtabar (2012)

The evidence suggests moderate semantic-behavioral coupling, with users sharing semantic neighborhoods showing some tendency toward similar behavioral patterns. However, this coupling is likely moderated by organizational factors, system design, and individual differences that are not captured by semantic analysis alone. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies in non-social, non-gamified enterprise environments to establish the strength and mechanisms of semantic-behavioral coupling in these practically important contexts.

# Typologies of Technology Users Based on Motivational Orientation: A Comprehensive Review


## Introduction

Understanding technology users extends far beyond demographic categorization. While traditional segmentation approaches have relied on observable characteristics such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status, a substantial body of research has emerged that segments users based on their underlying motivations—the psychological "why" behind their technology engagement rather than simply "what" they do,,. This motivational approach to user typology provides richer insights into user behavior, enabling a more nuanced understanding of technology adoption, sustained engagement, and user experience outcomes. This review synthesizes the literature on motivation-based user segmentation, examining theoretical foundations, empirical typologies, and methodological approaches that researchers have employed to understand the motivational heterogeneity among technology users.

## Theoretical Foundations for Motivation-Based User Segmentation


### Self-Determination Theory as a Framework

Self-Determination Theory (SDT) has emerged as a foundational framework for understanding motivational orientations in technology use,. Ryan and Deci's seminal work established that human beings can be "proactive and engaged or, alternatively, passive and alienated, largely as a function of the social conditions in which they develop and function". This theoretical perspective has been instrumental in shifting focus from external behavioral metrics to internal motivational states. SDT distinguishes between different types of motivation along a continuum from amotivation through external regulation, introjected regulation, identified regulation, integrated regulation, to intrinsic motivation,.
  - Citations: Ryan (2000), Bennett (2024)

The application of SDT to technology contexts has revealed that motivation and autonomy, while "fundamental concepts in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), yet in User Experience (UX) research they have remained surprisingly peripheral". Bennett and Mekler's research drew on SDT to analyze "autonomous and non-autonomous patterns of motivation in 497 interaction experiences," identifying through latent profile analysis "5 distinct patterns of motivation in technology use—'motivational profiles'—associated with significant differences in need satisfaction, affect, and usability". This demonstrates that users can be meaningfully segmented based on their position along the SDT motivation continuum.

### Hedonic and Utilitarian Motivational Dimensions

A complementary theoretical approach distinguishes between hedonic and utilitarian motivations for technology use. Research has established that "social influence, convenience and hedonic motivations" represent three factors of main importance in shaping user perception, with these factors affecting "each other" in complex ways. O'Brien's research on online shopping experiences suggests that "Hedonic Motivations may be more salient during the interaction with the technology, whereas utilitarian motivations may be more prominent before and/or after the experience has taken place". This temporal dimension adds complexity to motivation-based segmentation, suggesting that user typologies may need to account for shifting motivational orientations across different phases of technology engagement.

### Intrinsic Versus Extrinsic Motivation Distinctions

The distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations has proven particularly valuable for user segmentation. Research on innovation communities has illustrated "that the most important motivators for users' participation are intrinsic motivations such as learning, stimulating curiosity and being entertained". Similarly, studies on mobile services have found that "social norms and intrinsic motives such as enjoyment are important determinants of intention to use among female users, whereas extrinsic motives such as usefulness and—somewhat surprisingly—expressiveness are key drivers among men". These findings underscore that motivational orientations interact with demographic variables to produce distinct user segments,.

## Empirical Typologies of Technology Users


### Social Media User Segments

Research on social media platforms has generated several motivation-based typologies. Shao and colleagues developed "a motivation-based segmentation typology of Facebook users" in which "both Facebook user motivations as well as demographic variables are found to be useful in describing user segments". This research addressed a significant gap, noting that "despite the popularity of Facebook as a communication channel, from a marketing perspective little is known regarding Facebook user segments".
  - Citations: Shao et al. (2015)

Studies of online brand communities have identified that "users fall into three distinct segments with significant differences in user behavior: information-oriented users, entertainment-oriented users, and multi-motivation users". The information-oriented users "predominantly use the online brand community to gather information," while entertainment-oriented users exhibit features similar to "socializers" identified in prior research. This tripartite segmentation reflects fundamental differences in why users engage with online platforms.
  - Citations: St (2011)

Instagram-specific research has revealed additional nuance in social media user typologies. Kocak and colleagues identified six main usage motive categories: "self-expression, recording, socialization, recreation, creativity, and prying". Based on these motives, "Instagram users have been clustered as passionate, distant, and spectator users". Importantly, "personality differences among these clusters have been explored using the Big Five Inventory (BFI) and two additional traits, social interaction anxiety, and fear of negative evaluation," with "openness to experience, social interaction anxiety, and fear of negative evaluation" found to be "significantly different among these clusters".
  - Citations: Ny (2005)


### Virtual World and Gaming User Segments

Research on virtual worlds has identified distinct motivational drivers that segment users. Eisenbeiß and colleagues found that "socializing, creativity, and escape emerge as individual drivers" of virtual world engagement. Their analysis revealed "four latent segments, each characterized by a distinct motivational driver, and one segment that reflects mixed motives," with these segments differing "substantially in their descriptive characteristics (e.g., usage intensity, overall spending behavior)".
  - Citations: Ge et al. (2022)

In the gaming context, Brühlmann and colleagues employed the User Motivation Inventory (UMI) to conduct motivational profiling of League of Legends players. The UMI is "a validated 18-item questionnaire, which distinguishes amotivation, external regulation, introjected regulation, identified regulation, integrated regulation, and intrinsic motivation in the context of technology use". This instrument enables researchers to position users along the SDT motivation continuum, revealing qualitative differences in engagement patterns.
  - Citations: Br (2020)


### Health and Fitness Technology User Segments

The domain of health and fitness technology has produced particularly rich motivation-based typologies. Research on fitness app use has employed latent class analysis to uncover "heterogeneity in fitness app use and exercise behaviors," finding that "platform-based motivations and autonomy are important classification factors, as users are looking for specific kinds of gratification from their use of fitness apps". Class membership was associated with multiple factors including "gender, age, education, income, life satisfaction, autonomy, and platform-based motivations".
  - Citations: Kocak et al. (2020)

Kim and colleagues examined sport technology consumers, noting that "people's dispositions toward using technology-based products and services differ". This psychographic approach moves beyond behavioral metrics to capture the underlying psychological orientations that drive technology engagement.
  - Citations: Kim et al. (2019)

Research on wearable fitness technology has examined the intersection of "technological trust and self-determined motivation" in predicting usage intentions. Strong correlations were found "between the autonomy and competence subscales with moderate correlations between relatedness and the other factors," consistent with SDT predictions. The finding that "technological trust and motivation have not previously been examined together in the context of wearable fitness technology" highlights opportunities for more integrated approaches to user segmentation.
  - Citations: Eisenbei (2012)


### Information Sharing and Electronic Word-of-Mouth Typologies

Research on consumer articulation in online environments has developed motivation-based typologies for understanding why users share information. Hennig-Thurau and colleagues developed "a typology for motives of consumer online articulation," drawing on "findings from research on virtual communities and traditional word-of-mouth literature". Using "an online sample of some 2,000 consumers," they generated "information on the structure and relevance of the motives of consumers' online articulations".
  - Citations: Jiang et al. (2022)

Oh and Syn's comparative analysis across Facebook, Twitter, Delicious, YouTube, and Flickr tested "ten factors: enjoyment, self-efficacy, learning, personal gain, altruism, empathy, social engagement, community interest, reciprocity, and reputation" as motivations for information sharing. Their findings indicate that "all of the 10 motivations are influential in encouraging users' information sharing to some degree and strongly correlate with one another," while "motivations differ across the 5 types of social media, given that they deliver different information content and serve different purposes". This platform-specific variation in motivational profiles suggests that user typologies may need to be contextualized to specific technology environments.

## Methodological Approaches to Motivation-Based Segmentation


### Latent Profile and Latent Class Analysis

Latent profile analysis has emerged as a powerful methodological approach for identifying motivation-based user segments. Bennett and Mekler employed this technique to identify "5 distinct patterns of motivation in technology use". Similarly, Howard and colleagues applied latent profile analysis in work contexts, finding that "the amotivated and highly motivated profiles both follow the expected continuum structure so closely that it could be argued that for these profiles a single factor representing global self-determined motivation could be sufficient to describe these employees satisfactorily". However, "for the moderately autonomous and balanced profiles where the profiles do not follow the continuum structure as perfectly, it appears necessary to take into account qualitative distinctions between the various motivation subtypes".
  - Citations: Bennett (2024), Howard et al. (2016)

Latent class analysis has been applied to fitness app users, revealing "significant heterogeneity in fitness app use and exercise behaviors". This approach enables researchers to identify naturally occurring clusters of users based on their motivational patterns rather than imposing predetermined categories.
  - Citations: Kocak et al. (2020)


### Factor Analysis and Cluster Analysis

Traditional factor analysis combined with cluster analysis remains a common approach for developing motivation-based typologies. Guttentag and colleagues employed "an exploratory factor analysis" that "identified five motivating factors—Interaction, Home Benefits, Novelty, Sharing Economy Ethos, and Local Authenticity" among Airbnb users. "A subsequent cluster analysis divided the respondents into five segments—Money Savers, Home Seekers, Collaborative Consumers, Pragmatic Novelty Seekers, and Interactive Novelty Seekers". This two-stage approach first identifies underlying motivational dimensions and then clusters users based on their profiles across these dimensions.
  - Citations: Hennig (2004)

Hill and colleagues applied similar methods to segment adolescent online users, noting that "the decision to use motivations to segment adolescent users and shoppers follows from previous research that suggests motivations offer a rich approach for classification, as well as providing an understanding of the consumer's mentality". This approach captures "both nonshopping and shopping reasons" for internet use, providing "a more representative picture of the types of adolescent internet users and shoppers".
  - Citations: Hill et al. (2013)


### Validated Measurement Instruments

The development of validated instruments for measuring user motivation has advanced the field significantly. The User Motivation Inventory (UMI) "may potentially help predict how likely users are to abandon a technology if given the opportunity" and "may also serve to extend existing models of user experience that have already incorporated need satisfaction, as different motivational patterns can explain why people have different experiences (and consequences) when using a particular technology". The UMI specifically helps "to better understand the role of motivation in shaping" user experience.
  - Citations: Oh (2015)

The mHealth Technology Engagement Index (mTEI) represents another validated approach, developed to "bridge two disparate literatures: the research on motivation and the research on telehealth systems". This instrument recognizes that "telehealth technologies that foster motivation will result in more usage over the long term, thereby impacting patient health and satisfaction".
  - Citations: Guttentag et al. (2017)


## Cross-Cutting Themes and Integrative Perspectives


### The Role of Psychological Characteristics

Beyond motivational orientations per se, research has identified broader psychological characteristics that differentiate user segments. Vilnai-Yavetz and Tifferet's segmentation of consumers by Facebook profile images "reflects psychological characteristics such as sociability, creativity, empathizing or systemizing tendencies, multidimensionality, emotional expressivity, status seeking, a need to impress, and attitudes toward technology". Importantly, "these characteristics are implicitly embedded in the images posted by Facebook users," enabling segmentation that "avoids the pitfalls faced by previous segmentations of Facebook users, which were based on self-reports".
  - Citations: Br (2018)


### Technology Readiness and Disposition

Research has emphasized the importance of "consumers' readiness to use technology-based products and services" as a segmentation variable. This readiness encompasses attitudinal and motivational components that shape how users approach and engage with technology. The recognition that "people's dispositions toward using technology-based products and services differ"has motivated research into psychographic typologies that capture these dispositional differences.
  - Citations: Kim et al. (2019)


### Persona-Based Approaches

The engineering of motivation-aware systems has led to persona-based approaches that acknowledge "the high diversity in users' perception and acceptance of motivation strategies and their software-based incarnations". Shahri and colleagues "propose the use of personas as an intermediate step which increases efficiency in the engineering process for both engineers and users". This approach translates motivation-based user typologies into actionable design guidance.
  - Citations: Dewar et al. (2016)


### Temporal Dynamics of Motivation

Research has highlighted that motivational orientations may shift across the user experience. O'Brien's work emphasizes "the salience of different affective, cognitive, and interactive attributes at different points in time during an encounter between the user and a technology". This temporal perspective suggests that static typologies may need to be complemented by dynamic models that capture how users' motivational profiles evolve through their technology engagement journey.
  - Citations: Br (2020)


## Implications and Future Directions

The body of research on motivation-based user typologies has significant implications for technology design and marketing. Understanding that users engage with technology for fundamentally different reasons—whether for intrinsic enjoyment, social connection, information seeking, self-expression, or practical utility—enables more targeted and effective interventions,,. As Michaelis and colleagues note, "having a supportive technology allows users to more easily navigate this motivational phase," while "poorly designed technology will instead act as a barrier preventing success".
  - Citations: Hill et al. (2013), Shao et al. (2015), Rupp et al. (2016), Vilnai (2015)

The integration of motivation research with user experience models represents a promising direction. The recognition that "different motivational patterns can explain why people have different experiences (and consequences) when using a particular technology"suggests that motivation-based segmentation can enhance predictive models of user behavior and satisfaction. Furthermore, the finding that motivational profiles are "associated with significant differences in need satisfaction, affect, and usability"underscores the practical value of this approach for user experience research and design.

## Conclusion

Research on motivation-based user typologies has established that technology users can be meaningfully segmented by why they engage rather than simply what they do. Drawing on theoretical frameworks including Self-Determination Theory and hedonic-utilitarian distinctions, researchers have identified diverse user segments across social media, gaming, health technology, and information sharing contexts,,,,. Methodological advances including latent profile analysis, validated motivation inventories, and persona-based approaches have enabled increasingly sophisticated segmentation,,. This body of work demonstrates that understanding motivational heterogeneity among users provides insights that demographic segmentation alone cannot capture, with important implications for technology design, user experience research, and marketing strategy,,.

# Alternative Theoretical Frameworks for Explaining Sustained Technology Engagement


## Introduction

Understanding sustained technology engagement requires theoretical frameworks that extend beyond identity-based conceptualizations. While Carter et al.'s IT Identity Scale provides valuable insights into how individuals incorporate technology into their self-concept, multiple alternative theoretical perspectives offer complementary explanations for why users continue to engage with technology over time. This synthesis examines several prominent frameworks, including Uses and Gratifications Theory, engagement as a multidimensional construct, and related theoretical approaches that illuminate the mechanisms underlying persistent technology use.


## Uses and Gratifications Theory (UGT)

Uses and Gratifications Theory has emerged as a particularly valuable framework for understanding technology continuance intentions. Researchers have increasingly adopted UGT to study why users persist in their technology engagement behaviors. This theoretical approach provides guidance for investigating the specific needs that information technology users seek to fulfill while simultaneously offering a lens for exploring how technology can promote outcomes such as health empowerment. The fundamental premise of UGT—that users actively select and engage with media and technologies to satisfy particular psychological and social needs—makes it especially relevant for understanding sustained engagement patterns.

In the context of chronic disease management applications, for instance, UGT helps explain how meeting users' needs for health empowerment affects their continuance intention. This application demonstrates the theory's utility in explaining not merely initial adoption but ongoing, sustained engagement with technological tools. The gratifications perspective emphasizes that technology engagement persists when the technology continues to fulfill user needs effectively.

## Multidimensional Engagement Frameworks


### The Tripartite Model of Engagement

A robust body of research conceptualizes engagement as a multidimensional construct comprising behavioral, emotional, and cognitive components. This framework, originally developed within educational psychology, has been validated across multiple contexts and provides a comprehensive approach to understanding sustained engagement. Fredricks et al. established that engagement encompasses these three distinct yet interrelated dimensions, with the construct being presumed malleable, responsive to contextual features, and amenable to environmental change.
  - Citations: Fredricks et al. (2004), Moreira et al. (2021), Inman et al. (2020)

The multidimensional nature of engagement has been consistently supported through empirical research. Studies have identified six latent factors representing both engagement and disengagement across cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions. This finding aligns with the heavily supported framework that conceptualizes engagement as inherently multi-dimensional. The behavioral dimension captures observable actions and participation; the emotional dimension encompasses affective responses and feelings of connection; and the cognitive dimension involves mental investment and strategic thinking.
  - Citations: Moreira et al. (2021)


### Bifactor Modeling Approaches

Contemporary research has advanced understanding of engagement through sophisticated psychometric approaches. Evidence demonstrates that engagement should be modeled as a bifactor model for use with structural equation modeling or item response theory, while total scores across dimensions remain interpretable as indicators of a single higher-order construct. This methodological advancement supports engagement frameworks that recognize the complexity of the construct while maintaining practical utility for measurement and intervention.
  - Citations: Inman et al. (2020)

The development of validated instruments measuring engagement across multiple dimensions has been crucial for advancing both research and practice. These measures are built around a multidimensional perspective of engagement using bifactor modeling approaches, providing psychometrically sound foundations for capturing behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and social aspects of engagement.

### Engagement and Disengagement as Complementary Constructs

Recent theoretical developments have expanded engagement frameworks to include disengagement as a distinct but related construct. Research has provided psychometrically sound foundations for capturing not only engagement but also disengagement across behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and social dimensions. This dual-process perspective recognizes that understanding sustained engagement requires attention to both the factors that promote continued involvement and those that may lead to withdrawal or reduced participation.
  - Citations: Wang et al. (2019)


## Self-Determination Theory Foundations

Many engagement frameworks are grounded in self-determination theory, which emphasizes the importance of satisfying fundamental human needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. This motivational model provides a theoretical foundation for understanding why certain technology experiences promote sustained engagement while others do not. When technology use satisfies these basic psychological needs, users are more likely to maintain their engagement over time.
  - Citations: Moreira et al. (2019)

The integration of self-determination theory with engagement research highlights the role of context in shaping engagement outcomes. Technology environments that support user autonomy, provide opportunities for skill development, and facilitate social connection are theoretically positioned to promote more sustained engagement patterns.

## Stakeholder and Stewardship Perspectives


### Stakeholder Theory Applications

Stakeholder theory offers an alternative lens for understanding sustained engagement, particularly in organizational and collective contexts. This theoretical perspective emphasizes the importance of aligning actions with the interests and values of various stakeholders. When applied to technology engagement, stakeholder theory suggests that sustained use depends on the technology meeting the needs and expectations of multiple parties, not merely individual users.
  - Citations: Safav (2025)

The stakeholder perspective discourages opportunistic behavior and emphasizes long-term value creation over short-term gains. This orientation toward sustained relationships and mutual benefit provides a framework for understanding why certain technology ecosystems maintain user engagement over extended periods while others experience rapid user attrition.
  - Citations: Nguyen (2022)


### Stewardship Theory

Stewardship theory provides a complementary perspective by asserting that individuals will engage in pro-organizational, collectivist behaviors when they gain more satisfaction from serving the group than from serving themselves. This theoretical framework has been mobilized to understand trust and collaboration dynamics, advocating for long-term gains through actions beneficial to the broader community.
  - Citations: Prior et al. (2008), Zouari et al. (2024)

Applied to technology engagement, stewardship theory suggests that users may sustain their engagement when they perceive their participation as contributing to collective goods or community welfare. This perspective is particularly relevant for understanding engagement with collaborative technologies, open-source platforms, and community-oriented digital environments.


## Institutional and Contextual Influences

Institutional theory addresses how organizations and individuals are embedded within comprehensive systems of political, financial, educational, cultural, and economic institutions that exert pressure on behavior. This theoretical perspective states that actors should be accountable to the expectations of their institutional environment and adopt socially responsible behaviors.
  - Citations: Fiandrino et al. (2022)

For technology engagement, institutional theory illuminates how broader social, organizational, and cultural contexts shape sustained use patterns. Users may maintain engagement with particular technologies because of institutional expectations, professional norms, or social pressures rather than purely individual preferences or gratifications.


## Implementation and Sustainability Science Perspectives

Research on the sustainability of evidence-based interventions provides additional theoretical resources for understanding sustained technology engagement. Sustainability has been defined as the continued use of program components at sufficient levels to maintain desired outcomes. Implementation science has focused on understanding factors and strategies that influence not only initial adoption but also the integration of evidence-based interventions in real-world settings.
  - Citations: Shelton et al. (2018)

The Technology Adoption Readiness Scale represents one approach to understanding factors that contribute to the successful normalization of technology, serving either as a diagnostic tool or for evaluation purposes. This perspective emphasizes that sustained engagement depends on the successful integration of technology into ongoing practices and routines.
  - Citations: Lennox et al. (2018)


## Integrative Considerations


### The Role of Context and Malleability

A critical insight across multiple theoretical frameworks is that engagement is presumed to be malleable and responsive to contextual features. This suggests that sustained technology engagement is not a fixed characteristic of users but rather an outcome that can be influenced through environmental design and intervention. Technologies and their surrounding ecosystems can be modified to promote more sustained engagement patterns.
  - Citations: Fredricks et al. (2004)


### Learning Orientation and Adaptation

Complexity-based approaches to understanding sustained engagement emphasize the importance of learning orientation. This perspective proposes that sustained engagement requires ongoing adaptation and learning, with users and systems continuously adjusting to changing circumstances. The focus on ongoing learning ensures that individuals remain adaptable and skilled in implementing new practices as contexts evolve.
  - Citations: Kerkhoff (2013), Buriak (2024)


### Feedback and Recognition Mechanisms

Regular feedback mechanisms allow for course correction and improvement, while recognizing and rewarding contributions strengthens engagement and motivates continued involvement. This insight suggests that sustained technology engagement depends not merely on initial design features but on ongoing processes of feedback, recognition, and adaptation.
  - Citations: Buriak (2024)


## Synthesis and Theoretical Integration

The theoretical frameworks reviewed here offer complementary rather than competing explanations for sustained technology engagement. Uses and Gratifications Theory emphasizes the active role of users in selecting technologies that meet their needs. Multidimensional engagement frameworks highlight the behavioral, emotional, and cognitive components that must be addressed for sustained involvement. Self-determination theory provides a motivational foundation emphasizing autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Stakeholder and stewardship theories illuminate the social and collective dimensions of sustained engagement. Institutional theory addresses broader contextual influences, while implementation science perspectives focus on factors supporting long-term sustainability.
  - Citations: Liu et al. (2021), Fredricks et al. (2004), Moreira et al. (2021), Inman et al. (2020), Moreira et al. (2019), Prior et al. (2008), Safav (2025), Zouari et al. (2024), Fiandrino et al. (2022), Lennox et al. (2018), Shelton et al. (2018)

Together, these frameworks suggest that sustained technology engagement emerges from the intersection of individual needs and gratifications, multidimensional engagement processes, motivational supports, social and institutional contexts, and ongoing adaptation and learning. No single theoretical framework fully captures this complexity, but their integration provides a comprehensive foundation for understanding why users continue to engage with technology over time.


## Conclusion

Beyond identity-based approaches, multiple theoretical frameworks offer valuable explanations for sustained technology engagement. Uses and Gratifications Theory provides insight into how need fulfillment drives continuance intentions. Multidimensional engagement frameworks emphasize the behavioral, emotional, and cognitive components of sustained involvement. Self-determination theory highlights the motivational foundations of engagement, while stakeholder and stewardship perspectives illuminate social and collective dimensions. Institutional theory addresses contextual influences, and implementation science perspectives focus on sustainability factors. The integration of these diverse theoretical resources provides a comprehensive foundation for understanding, predicting, and promoting sustained technology engagement across varied contexts and user populations.

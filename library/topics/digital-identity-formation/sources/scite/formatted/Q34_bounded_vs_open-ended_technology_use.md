# Distinguishing Bounded from Open-Ended Technology Use: Engagement Patterns, Retention, and User Trajectories


## Introduction

The distinction between bounded technology use (characterized by finite tasks with clear endpoints) and open-ended technology use (ongoing processes without natural termination) represents a critical conceptual framework for understanding differential user engagement patterns. While the provided references do not directly address this specific dichotomy in technology use research, they offer relevant insights into engagement constructs, longitudinal user trajectories, and retention dynamics that can inform our understanding of these phenomena. This synthesis draws upon available evidence regarding technology engagement, user behavior patterns, and methodological considerations for studying technology use over time.


## Conceptual Foundations of Engagement in Technology Contexts


### Multidimensional Nature of Engagement

Research on engagement has established that it should be studied as a multifaceted construct encompassing behavioral, emotional, and cognitive dimensions. Fredricks et al. emphasize that engagement is “presumed to be malleable, responsive to contextual features, and amenable to environmental change”. This framework, while developed in educational contexts, provides a foundation for understanding how technology use patterns may differ based on task structure. The malleability of engagement suggests that the bounded or open-ended nature of technology tasks may significantly influence how users engage across these three dimensions.

### Technology Acceptance and Use Patterns

Research on technology adoption has examined the logic behind technology use by expanding theoretical frameworks such as the Technology Acceptance Model. Turel et al. note that understanding technology use requires examining “important predictors of perceived ease of use and usefulness, including beliefs regarding system design”. This suggests that the design characteristics that distinguish bounded from open-ended technologies—such as clear task completion indicators versus continuous content streams—may fundamentally shape user engagement trajectories.

## Differential Engagement Patterns


### ICT Usage and Engagement Relationships

Evidence from educational technology research demonstrates that “ICT usage enables more engaging learning environments” and that “ICTs can communicate new material, make learning more fun and make it easier for pupils to participate”. Naluwooza et al. found that “ICT usage has significant and positive effect on pupil engagement”. However, this research does not differentiate between bounded learning tasks with clear completion criteria and open-ended exploratory learning, representing a gap in the literature regarding how task structure moderates engagement outcomes.

### Work-Related Technology Use Patterns

Research on work-related information and communication technology (ICT) use reveals important patterns relevant to understanding bounded versus open-ended engagement. Heissler et al. conducted longitudinal research examining when “thinking about work makes employees reach for their devices” and found that “unfinished work tasks precede ICT use”. This finding suggests that bounded tasks with clear endpoints may generate different engagement patterns than ongoing, open-ended work processes. The researchers note that “work-related ICT use should not be treated as a stressor in its own right”, implying that the nature of the task—whether bounded or open-ended—may be more determinative of user experience than technology use per se.
  - Citations: Heissler et al. (2022)

The phenomenon of technology creating a sense of “anytime, anywhere contactability” has been documented in research on ICT and work-life boundaries. Hislop et al. observe that “technologies such as laptop computers, tablet computers and smartphones are being used as devices to both carry out work-related tasks and to manage the work-life boundary”. This suggests that open-ended technology use patterns may blur traditional boundaries in ways that bounded, task-specific use does not.
  - Citations: Hislop et al. (2013)


### Stress and Engagement Dynamics

The technostress literature provides insights into how different patterns of technology engagement affect user outcomes. Ragu-Nathan et al. developed a “nomological net for technostress to understand the influence of technostress on three variables relating to end users of ICTs: job satisfaction, and organizational and continuance commitment”. While this research does not explicitly distinguish bounded from open-ended use, the construct of continuance commitment is particularly relevant, as it relates to users’ intentions to persist with technology over time. Open-ended technology use may generate different stress profiles than bounded use, potentially affecting long-term engagement patterns.
  - Citations: Ragu (2008)

Research by Barley et al. on email as “a source and symbol of stress” found that email “distracted people from recognizing other sources of overload in their work lives”. This finding is relevant to understanding open-ended technology use, as email represents a paradigmatic example of technology without natural termination points. The symbolic function of such technologies may contribute to distinctive engagement patterns compared to bounded task-oriented tools.

## Retention Rates and Longitudinal Considerations


### Methodological Challenges in Studying Retention

Research on retention in longitudinal studies provides important methodological insights applicable to understanding technology user retention. Teague et al. conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of retention strategies, noting that “differences between intervention and longitudinal cohort studies, such as research design factors (e.g., study duration) and the motivations of the participants in joining or withdrawing from studies, may impact the usefulness of retention strategies across both study designs”. This observation suggests that retention dynamics may differ substantially between bounded technology interventions and ongoing technology use contexts.
  - Citations: Teague et al. (2018)

Jong et al. emphasize that “the research protocol for longitudinal studies should detail a planned, systematic approach of participant follow-up and detail the effectiveness of their recruitment and retention strategies”. They highlight concerns about “poor reporting of recruitment retention information” and recommend that “additional detail should be provided in reports on the success of each method, e.g., how many participants signed-up; how many participants returned/continued involvement in the study, and after what period”. These methodological standards are essential for distinguishing retention patterns between bounded and open-ended technology use contexts.
  - Citations: Jong et al. (2023)


### Factors Affecting Technology Adoption Intensity

Research on organizational technology adoption provides insights into differential use patterns. Galliano and Roux examined “the reasons why firms use ICTs at varying rates, by making a distinction between the two stages of their diffusion: their adoption and the intensity of their use”. They posed the question: “What are the differences between Internet adopters (in terms of their internal organization and external environment) that explain the intensity with which they use this technology?”. This distinction between adoption and intensity of use is relevant to understanding how bounded versus open-ended technologies may generate different usage trajectories.
  - Citations: Galliano (2007)

Vasarhelyi and Romero found in their case study that “the characteristics of the audit team largely determine the levels of technology utilization” and that “the integration of technology support teams and auditors may improve usability, and, consequently, increase technology adoption”. This suggests that user characteristics and support structures may moderate the relationship between task structure and retention patterns.
  - Citations: Vasarhelyi (2014)


## User Trajectories Across Time


### Longitudinal Trajectory Analysis

Research employing accelerated longitudinal designs provides methodological frameworks for understanding user trajectories. Joiner et al. used “an accelerated longitudinal design to map the developmental trajectories” of affective experience, noting that while “previous studies have compared cross-sectional and longitudinal age-affect associations,” rigorous empirical validation of such comparisons remains limited. This methodological approach could be applied to distinguish trajectories of bounded versus open-ended technology users.
  - Citations: Joiner et al. (2018)

The importance of trajectory analysis is further emphasized by Gerhardt and Mackenzie-Philps, who investigated “the correlation and trajectory of ICT pervasiveness” among adult learners. They noted that “ICT usage is only confined to the measurement of usage frequency while few studies have considered the influence of actual usage on performance impact”. Their interest in “both: the correlation between the usage and impact and the potential correlation in the trajectory of each”highlights the need for research that tracks how bounded and open-ended technology use patterns evolve over time.
  - Citations: Gerhardt (2018)


### Engagement Trajectories in Educational Contexts

Longitudinal research on student engagement provides relevant evidence for understanding technology user trajectories. Sousa found that “retained students experienced a statistically significant decline in student engagement with school over time compared to non-retained students”. While focused on educational retention rather than technology use, this research demonstrates how engagement trajectories can diverge based on structural factors. By analogy, users of bounded technologies with clear completion points may exhibit different engagement trajectories than users of open-ended technologies.
  - Citations: Sousa (2025)


### Health and Well-being Trajectories

Research on ICT use and health outcomes provides additional perspective on user trajectories. Borle et al. examined “the social and health implications of digital work intensification” and found that “the only relevant correlation found was the one between ICT use and physical health”. They noted that “associations of ICT use with mental health were not statistically significant”. These findings suggest that the health-related trajectories of technology users may depend on factors beyond simple use patterns, potentially including whether use is bounded or open-ended.
  - Citations: Borle et al. (2020)

Chang et al. documented that evening use of light-emitting devices “negatively affects sleep, circadian timing, and next-morning alertness”. They emphasized that “technology use in the hours before bedtime is most prevalent in children and adolescents” and called for “physiological studies on the impact of such light exposure on both learning and development”. This research suggests that open-ended technology use patterns, particularly those without natural stopping points, may have distinctive physiological trajectory implications.
  - Citations: Chang et al. (2014)


## Digital Divide and Differential Access Patterns


### Heterogeneity in Technology Use Motivations

Research on older adults’ ICT use reveals important heterogeneity in technology engagement patterns. Yu et al. noted that “prior studies established broad correlations between ICT use and life satisfaction in older adults” but “often overlooked motivational heterogeneity”. Using latent profile analysis guided by Self-Determination Theory, they found that “autonomy and competence are essential nutrients for psychological satisfaction”. This suggests that bounded technologies that provide clear competence feedback may generate different engagement profiles than open-ended technologies.
  - Citations: Yu et al. (2025)


### Exclusion and Access Patterns

The digital divide literature addresses differential patterns of technology access and use. Bach et al. note that “DD research is mainly oriented towards detection of differences in the ICT use among individuals” and that “an important part of DD research refers to the differences in ICT adoption and use among corporations”. Understanding how bounded versus open-ended technologies may differentially affect various populations represents an important extension of this research.
  - Citations: Bach et al. (2022)

Seifert et al. discuss “the potential outcomes of this exclusion” in the context of digital and social exclusion of older adults. Their focus on “older adults in long-term care facilities”highlights how certain populations may be differentially affected by technology design choices, including whether technologies are structured as bounded or open-ended experiences.
  - Citations: Seifert et al. (2020)


## Implications for Research and Practice


### Measurement Considerations

The distinction between bounded and open-ended technology use has important implications for measurement. Busse et al. examined “the association between work-related ICT exposure (i.e. ICT use and digital work intensification) and job dissatisfaction”. Their focus on “ICT exposure” as a constructsuggests that researchers should consider whether exposure to bounded versus open-ended technologies may have differential effects on user outcomes.
  - Citations: Busse et al. (2022)

Raman and Thannimalai utilized multiple instruments to measure technology integration, including measures of “ICT Use in the Curriculum”. Such measurement approaches could be adapted to distinguish between bounded task-oriented technology use and open-ended exploratory use.
  - Citations: Raman (2019)


### Theoretical Integration

The integration of technology addiction and use research provides a framework for understanding problematic patterns of open-ended technology engagement. Turel et al. examined “online auction users” as a context for understanding technology use patterns. Online auctions represent an interesting hybrid case—individual auctions are bounded with clear endpoints, but the platform itself enables open-ended engagement. This suggests that the bounded/open-ended distinction may operate at multiple levels of analysis.
  - Citations: Turel et al. (2011)


## Limitations and Future Directions

The available references do not directly address the specific research question regarding how researchers have distinguished bounded from open-ended technology use. While the literature on engagement, retention, and user trajectories provides relevant conceptual and methodological foundations, there is a notable gap in research explicitly comparing these two modes of technology interaction.

Future research should develop validated instruments for measuring the bounded versus open-ended nature of technology use, conduct longitudinal studies comparing engagement trajectories across technology types, and examine how individual differences moderate the effects of task structure on user outcomes. The multidimensional engagement framework proposed by Fredricks et al.—encompassing behavioral, emotional, and cognitive dimensions—provides a promising foundation for such investigations.

## Conclusion

While the provided references do not offer direct evidence on the distinction between bounded and open-ended technology use, they illuminate relevant constructs and methodological approaches. Engagement research establishes that user involvement is multifaceted and context-dependent. Technology use research reveals complex relationships between ICT exposure and user outcomes,,. Retention research highlights the importance of longitudinal designs and systematic tracking,. Together, these literatures suggest that bounded and open-ended technology use likely generate differential engagement patterns, retention rates, and user trajectories, though direct empirical investigation of these differences remains an important direction for future research.

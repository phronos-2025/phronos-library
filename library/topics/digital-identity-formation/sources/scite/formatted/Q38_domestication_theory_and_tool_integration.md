# Domestication Framework and the Shift from Relational to Instrumental Framing in Extended Technology Use


## Introduction

Roger Silverstone's domestication framework provides a comprehensive theoretical lens for understanding how technologies transition from novel commodities to integrated elements of everyday life. The framework conceptualizes this process through four interrelated phases: appropriation, objectification, incorporation, and conversion,,. This analysis examines how these phases illuminate the shift from relational to instrumental framing in extended technology use, and identifies the critical juncture at which technology transforms from "partner" to "tool."

## The Four Phases of Domestication: A Theoretical Overview


### Appropriation: Initial Acquisition and Ownership

Appropriation represents the foundational phase wherein technology "leaves the world of commodity and the generalized system of equivalence and exchange, and is taken possession of by an individual or household and owned". This phase "reveals itself in possession and ownership" and encompasses "the types of negotiations and considerations that led to the acquisition of technologies". During appropriation, users engage in active negotiation with the technology, establishing initial relationships characterized by exploration and meaning-making. The domestication framework fundamentally critiques technological determinism by allowing for analysis of "frictions, malfunctions, irresponsiveness, complexities, and all sorts of unexpected events", suggesting that early technology encounters are inherently relational as users navigate uncertainty and establish mutual understanding with their devices.

### Objectification: Spatial and Symbolic Placement

Objectification concerns the spatial location of technologies within the household and their symbolic display,. This phase involves determining where technologies physically reside and what meanings they acquire through their placement. The objectification process represents symbolic work wherein users create meaning around their technologies. During this phase, technologies begin acquiring fixed positions within domestic environments, though they retain significant symbolic value as users negotiate their role within household dynamics.

### Incorporation: Integration into Daily Routines

Incorporation represents the phase where technologies become embedded within users' temporal structures and daily practices,. This phase concerns "the use of technology into users' routine and time structure"and involves the integration of media "into the routines of everyday life". The domestication process involves "practical, symbolic and cognitive dimensions", with incorporation representing the practical dimension where technology use becomes habitualized. Research on mobile phone incorporation among older users demonstrates that this phase involves a "multidimensional negotiation process among users, artifacts, and social contexts".

### Conversion: Identity and External Display

Conversion addresses "how users mobilize the technology as part of their identity and how" they present it externally. This phase involves "the display of media to others as part of identity work"and represents the culmination of the domestication process where technology becomes fully integrated into users' self-presentation and social relationships. The conversion phase marks the transition from private negotiation to public display, where technology use becomes part of one's social identity.

## The Relational-to-Instrumental Shift: Theoretical Analysis


### Early Phases: Relational Framing Predominates

During appropriation and early objectification, technology use is characterized by what can be understood as relational framing. The domestication framework's metaphorical rendering of "a technological artefact as a beast to be tamed"emphasizes the interactive, negotiated nature of early technology encounters. This metaphor suggests a relationship between user and technology characterized by mutual adjustment, uncertainty, and ongoing dialogue. The framework positions domestication as "an ongoing struggle between users and technology where the user attempts to take control of the technological artifact", indicating that early phases involve active engagement rather than passive tool use.
  - Citations: Bavngaard (2025), Ballon (2015)

Research demonstrates that during initial phases, users engage in complex negotiations involving "adaptation, negotiation, resistance, and rejection involving humans and non-humans". This negotiation process implies a relational dynamic where technology is treated as an entity with agency requiring accommodation rather than a passive instrument awaiting deployment. The domestication perspective analyzes "technology use in context", emphasizing that early technology adoption involves contextual sensitivity and relational awareness.
  - Citations: Caetano (2025), Leong (2017)


### The Incorporation Phase: The Critical Transition Point

The incorporation phase represents the pivotal juncture where relational framing begins transitioning toward instrumental framing. As technologies become integrated into daily routines and temporal structures,, they progressively lose their novelty and the negotiated quality that characterized earlier phases. The process of incorporation involves technologies becoming "an integral part of family life", suggesting a normalization that reduces the active relational engagement characteristic of earlier phases.
  - Citations: Ju et al. (2023), Mart (2022), Zhang (2025)

Evidence from studies of technology domestication among various populations indicates that incorporation involves the routinization of technology use,. When technologies become embedded in habitual practices, users no longer engage with them as entities requiring negotiation but rather as tools serving predetermined functions. The "hierarchy of mobile phone incorporation"suggests that incorporation proceeds through stages of increasing integration, with each stage representing further movement from relational to instrumental framing.
  - Citations: Nimrod (2015), Frennert (2014)

The incorporation phase involves what has been described as "practical work (for example, changing patterns of use and daily routines)". This practical dimension emphasizes functionality over relationship, suggesting that as technologies become incorporated, they are increasingly evaluated by their utility rather than their relational qualities. The transition from "direct oversight to indirect support" observed in family technology useexemplifies this shift from active relational engagement to instrumental deployment.
  - Citations: Carter et al. (2013), Zhang (2025)


### Conversion: Consolidation of Instrumental Framing

By the conversion phase, the shift to instrumental framing is largely complete. Technologies have become tools for identity construction and social display,rather than partners in ongoing negotiation. The conversion phase represents what might be termed the "stabilization" of technology use, where the dynamic, negotiated quality of earlier phases gives way to settled patterns of instrumental deployment.
  - Citations: Ju et al. (2023), Mart (2022), Bavngaard (2025)

Research on technology domestication as stabilization emphasizes "the complex processual dynamics of negotiating technology's roles in the lives of its users", but this negotiation progressively diminishes as domestication proceeds. By conversion, technologies serve as resources for identity work rather than entities with which users maintain active relationships.
  - Citations: Bavngaard (2025)


## When Tool Replaces Partner: The Incorporation Threshold


### The Critical Transition Point

Based on synthesis of the domestication literature, the transition from partner to tool occurs primarily during theincorporation phase, with the shift consolidating during conversion. Several factors support this identification:

First, incorporation represents the phase where technology use becomes routinized and habitual,,. Habitualization inherently reduces the active engagement and mutual adjustment characteristic of relational framing. When technology use becomes automatic, the negotiated quality of the relationship diminishes.
  - Citations: Nimrod (2015), Ju et al. (2023), Mart (2022)

Second, the incorporation phase emphasizes temporal integration—fitting technology into existing routines and time structures. This temporal embedding transforms technology from an entity requiring attention and accommodation into a tool serving predetermined temporal slots. The "practical work"of incorporation prioritizes functionality over relationship.
  - Citations: Ju et al. (2023), Carter et al. (2013)

Third, research on domestication among older adults demonstrates that incorporation involves developing "strategies of actions and styles of agency"that become stabilized over time. This stabilization represents the crystallization of instrumental patterns that replace earlier relational dynamics.
  - Citations: Frennert (2014)


### Factors Influencing Transition Timing

The timing and completeness of the relational-to-instrumental shift varies based on several factors identified in the domestication literature. The domestication process is "never completely finished", suggesting that some relational elements may persist even in highly domesticated technologies. Additionally, the framework acknowledges that domestication involves ongoing "synergies" between emerging and established technologies, indicating that new technological developments may reintroduce relational dynamics.
  - Citations: Ahrens (2013), Nag (2017)

Research on diverse populations demonstrates that domestication proceeds differently across contexts,. Rural and urban users, for example, may experience different trajectories through the domestication phases, suggesting that the partner-to-tool transition is not uniform but contextually mediated.

## Implications and Conclusions


### Theoretical Implications

The domestication framework reveals that the shift from relational to instrumental framing is not a discrete event but a gradual process occurring primarily during incorporation and consolidating during conversion. The framework's emphasis on domestication as involving "practical, symbolic and cognitive dimensions"suggests that the transition occurs across multiple registers simultaneously.
  - Citations: Bavngaard (2025)

The metaphor of domestication as "taming"implies that the relational quality of early technology encounters is progressively subdued rather than eliminated. Technologies become "members of the household"through a process that transforms their status from negotiating partners to domesticated tools.
  - Citations: Bavngaard (2025), Tang et al. (2022)


### Practical Implications

Understanding the incorporation phase as the critical transition point has implications for technology design and user experience. If relational framing is valued—for example, in companion technologies or therapeutic applications—designers might consider strategies to maintain the negotiated quality characteristic of earlier domestication phases. Conversely, if instrumental efficiency is prioritized, facilitating rapid incorporation may be desirable.

The domestication framework's attention to "frictions, malfunctions, irresponsiveness, complexities, and all sorts of unexpected events"suggests that disruptions to routinized use may temporarily restore relational dynamics. This insight has implications for understanding how technology updates, malfunctions, or contextual changes might shift users back toward relational framing.
  - Citations: Caetano (2025)


### Conclusion

Silverstone's domestication framework illuminates the shift from relational to instrumental framing as a progressive process occurring across the four phases of appropriation, objectification, incorporation, and conversion. The critical transition from partner to tool occurs primarily during the incorporation phase, when technologies become embedded in daily routines and temporal structures. By the conversion phase, technologies have been fully domesticated as instruments for identity work and social display, with the negotiated, relational quality of earlier phases largely superseded by instrumental deployment. This analysis contributes to understanding how extended technology use transforms the human-technology relationship from dynamic partnership to stabilized tool use.

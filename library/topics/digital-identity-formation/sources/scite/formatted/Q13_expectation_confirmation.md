# Expectation-Confirmation Dynamics in First Interactions and Continued Engagement with Conversational Agents


## Introduction

The proliferation of conversational agents and chatbots across diverse sectors—from banking and healthcare to e-commerce and customer service—has created an urgent need to understand the mechanisms that sustain user engagement beyond initial adoption. While considerable research has examined the factors driving initial technology acceptance, the dynamics governing continued use remain less thoroughly explored. Expectation-confirmation theory (ECT) provides a robust theoretical framework for understanding how users' initial expectations, when confirmed or disconfirmed through first interactions, shape their subsequent intentions to continue engaging with conversational agents. This synthesis examines how expectation-confirmation dynamics in first interactions fundamentally influence continued engagement with chatbots and conversational agents across multiple contexts.


## Theoretical Foundations of Expectation-Confirmation Theory


### The Expectation-Confirmation Model in Information Systems

The expectation-confirmation model (ECM) represents a foundational theoretical framework adapted from consumer behavior literature to explain information systems continuance. Bhattacherjee's seminal work established that cognitive beliefs and affective responses significantly influence users' intentions to continue using information systems. The model posits that users form initial expectations about a system's performance, and their continued use depends substantially on whether actual performance confirms these expectations. This theoretical foundation has proven particularly valuable for understanding chatbot continuance, as it directly addresses the psychological mechanisms underlying sustained engagement.
  - Citations: Bhattacherjee (2001)

The ECM operates through a specific causal pathway: initial expectations lead to actual usage experiences, which generate confirmation or disconfirmation perceptions. These confirmation perceptions subsequently influence user satisfaction, which in turn drives continuance intentions. This sequential process is particularly relevant to first interactions with conversational agents, where users' initial expectations are most malleable and their confirmation experiences most impactful.
  - Citations: Bhattacherjee (2001)


### Cognitive and Affective Dimensions of Satisfaction

Understanding expectation-confirmation dynamics requires examining both cognitive and affective components of user satisfaction. Oliver's foundational research on satisfaction responses identified that disconfirmation perceptions operate alongside separate dimensions of positive and negative affect. This multidimensional structure suggests that users' continued engagement with chatbots depends not merely on whether expectations are met, but on the emotional tenor of that confirmation experience. When first interactions with conversational agents confirm expectations while simultaneously generating positive affect, the likelihood of continued engagement increases substantially.
  - Citations: Oliver (1993)

The integration of cognitive and affective dimensions proves particularly important in chatbot contexts, where users may experience confirmation of functional expectations (e.g., receiving accurate information) while simultaneously experiencing negative affect (e.g., frustration with interface design or perceived lack of empathy). This dissociation between cognitive confirmation and affective response can significantly moderate the relationship between confirmation and continuance intention.


## Expectation-Confirmation Dynamics in Chatbot Continuance


### Confirmation as a Primary Driver of Continuance Intention

Empirical research across multiple chatbot contexts consistently demonstrates that confirmation of initial expectations represents a primary determinant of continued use. In the context of online travel agencies, confirmation is positively associated with satisfaction, which in turn influences use continuance intention. This finding extends across diverse applications: in banking chatbots, confirmation of service expectations significantly predicts continuance behavior, while in academic contexts, confirmation demonstrates substantial positive correlation with students' intentions to continue using AI-chatbots for assignment assistance.
  - Citations: Li et al. (2021), Nguyen et al. (2021), Sari et al. (2024)

The mechanism through which confirmation operates appears consistent across contexts. Users enter first interactions with conversational agents harboring specific expectations regarding performance, reliability, and responsiveness. When these expectations are confirmed during initial encounters, users develop greater confidence in the system's capabilities and develop more favorable attitudes toward continued engagement,,. Conversely, disconfirmation—particularly negative disconfirmation where performance falls below expectations—substantially diminishes continuance intentions.
  - Citations: Sari et al. (2024), Nguyen et al. (2021), Li et al. (2021)


### The Role of Perceived Quality and Performance

First interactions with conversational agents establish critical baseline perceptions regarding system quality and performance. Research integrating DeLone and McLean's information systems success model with expectation-confirmation theory reveals that perceived information quality, system quality, and perceived usefulness emerge as foundational factors influencing confirmation perceptions. In pharmaceutical e-commerce contexts, perceived flexibility, accuracy, reliability, and convenience of AI chatbots positively influence service expectation confirmation, thereby establishing the cognitive foundation for continued engagement.
  - Citations: Nguyen et al. (2021), Jia et al. (2025)

The importance of performance confirmation in first interactions cannot be overstated. When users' initial interactions with chatbots demonstrate high accuracy, appropriate responsiveness, and reliable functionality, confirmation perceptions strengthen substantially. These early performance confirmations establish what might be termed "confirmation momentum"—a psychological state wherein users develop increasingly favorable expectations for subsequent interactions, creating a positive feedback loop that sustains engagement,.
  - Citations: Jia et al. (2025), Sari et al. (2024), Nguyen et al. (2021)


### Satisfaction as a Mediating Mechanism

While confirmation represents a direct driver of continuance intention, satisfaction functions as a critical mediating mechanism through which confirmation influences sustained engagement. Across multiple chatbot applications, confirmation demonstrates consistent positive association with satisfaction, which subsequently predicts continuance intention,,. This mediation pathway suggests that confirmation's influence on continued engagement operates partially through its capacity to generate user satisfaction.
  - Citations: Sari et al. (2024), Nguyen et al. (2021), Li et al. (2021)

The satisfaction generated through expectation confirmation in first interactions appears particularly consequential. When initial interactions with conversational agents confirm expectations while generating positive emotional responses, users develop robust satisfaction that extends beyond the specific interaction to influence general attitudes toward the system,. This satisfaction-based mechanism proves especially important in contexts where users have limited prior experience with conversational agents, as first interactions disproportionately shape overall satisfaction trajectories.
  - Citations: Sari et al. (2024), Jia et al. (2025)


## Contextual Variations in Expectation-Confirmation Dynamics


### Mental Health and Therapeutic Applications

In mental health contexts, expectation-confirmation dynamics operate within a distinctive framework shaped by therapeutic objectives and psychological vulnerability. Research on conversational agents delivering cognitive-behavioral therapy demonstrates that users' initial expectations regarding therapeutic efficacy, accessibility, and emotional support significantly influence continued engagement,. First interactions that confirm expectations for convenient, non-judgmental support substantially increase adherence and continued use,.
  - Citations: Fitzpatrick et al. (2017), Striegl et al. (2024)

The affective dimension of confirmation proves particularly salient in therapeutic contexts. Users entering first interactions with mental health chatbots often harbor expectations regarding empathetic responsiveness and emotional understanding. When these expectations are confirmed—through conversational agents demonstrating appropriate emotional recognition and supportive language—users develop greater trust and commitment to continued engagement. Conversely, first interactions that disconfirm expectations for emotional understanding may substantially diminish continuance intentions, even if functional performance meets expectations.
  - Citations: Striegl et al. (2024)


### Banking and Financial Services

In banking contexts, expectation-confirmation dynamics center on reliability, security, and transactional accuracy. Research on banking chatbots reveals that perceived performance, perceived trust, and corporate reputation significantly affect customer satisfaction with chatbot use. First interactions that confirm expectations for secure, accurate financial transactions establish the trust foundation necessary for continued engagement,.
  - Citations: Eren (2021), Nguyen et al. (2021)

The banking context illustrates how confirmation of specific performance dimensions influences broader continuance intentions. Users entering first interactions with banking chatbots typically prioritize confirmation of security expectations and transactional accuracy,. When these critical expectations are confirmed, users develop confidence extending beyond the specific transaction to influence general attitudes toward chatbot-mediated banking,. This context-specific confirmation pattern demonstrates that expectation-confirmation dynamics operate within domain-specific frameworks where certain performance dimensions carry disproportionate weight.
  - Citations: Nguyen et al. (2021), Eren (2021)


### E-Commerce and Customer Service

In e-commerce contexts, expectation-confirmation dynamics encompass both utilitarian and hedonic dimensions. Research on restaurant recommendation chatbots reveals that effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, and price value significantly predict continued use intentions. First interactions that confirm expectations for effortless interaction and enjoyable engagement substantially increase continuance intentions.
  - Citations: Romero-Charneco et al. (2025)

The e-commerce context highlights the importance of hedonic confirmation alongside utilitarian confirmation. Users entering first interactions with e-commerce chatbots expect not merely functional performance but also engaging, enjoyable interaction. When first interactions confirm both utilitarian expectations (e.g., accurate product information) and hedonic expectations (e.g., engaging conversational style), continuance intentions strengthen substantially. This dual-confirmation mechanism suggests that expectation-confirmation dynamics in consumer-facing chatbots operate across multiple value dimensions simultaneously.
  - Citations: Romero-Charneco et al. (2025)


## Moderating and Mediating Factors in Expectation-Confirmation Dynamics


### Technology Anxiety and User Characteristics

Individual differences in technology anxiety and AI hesitancy substantially moderate the relationship between confirmation and continuance intention. Research on AI chatbots for mental health reveals that AI hesitancy represents a significant factor predicting adoption and continued use intentions. Users entering first interactions with high technology anxiety or AI hesitancy may require more robust confirmation experiences to overcome initial skepticism and develop continuance intentions.
  - Citations: Li et al. (2024)

The moderating role of technology anxiety suggests that expectation-confirmation dynamics operate within a framework of individual predispositions. Users with high technology anxiety may enter first interactions with lower baseline expectations and heightened skepticism regarding chatbot capabilities. Consequently, confirmation experiences must be particularly salient and unambiguous to overcome these predispositions and generate sufficient satisfaction to sustain engagement. This moderation pattern indicates that first interactions must be calibrated to users' baseline technology orientations to effectively translate confirmation into continuance intentions.
  - Citations: Li et al. (2024)


### Trust and Relationship Quality

Trust emerges as a critical mediating and moderating factor in expectation-confirmation dynamics. Research integrating trust into expectation-confirmation models reveals that confirmation influences continuance intention partially through its capacity to generate trust in the chatbot and the organization operating it,. First interactions that confirm expectations while simultaneously demonstrating trustworthiness establish the relational foundation necessary for sustained engagement,.
  - Citations: Nguyen et al. (2021), Eren (2021)

The relationship between confirmation and trust appears bidirectional. Initial expectations regarding trustworthiness influence how users interpret confirmation experiences, while confirmation experiences subsequently shape trust development,. First interactions that confirm expectations for reliability and security while demonstrating organizational commitment to user welfare generate robust trust that extends beyond the specific interaction to influence general continuance intentions,.
  - Citations: Nguyen et al. (2021), Eren (2021)


### Anthropomorphism and Social Presence

The degree to which conversational agents exhibit anthropomorphic characteristics and social presence substantially influences how confirmation experiences translate into continuance intentions. Research on pharmaceutical e-commerce chatbots reveals that anthropomorphism does not significantly impact service expectation confirmation, suggesting that users' expectations regarding human-like qualities may not substantially influence confirmation perceptions. However, other research indicates that perceived anthropomorphism and social presence significantly influence adoption intentions, suggesting complex relationships between these factors and expectation-confirmation dynamics.
  - Citations: Jia et al. (2025), Elkhatibi (2024)

This apparent contradiction may reflect context-specific variations in the salience of anthropomorphic expectations. In transactional contexts (e.g., pharmaceutical e-commerce), users may prioritize functional confirmation over anthropomorphic confirmation, whereas in relational contexts (e.g., mental health support), anthropomorphic confirmation may prove more consequential,. First interactions must therefore calibrate anthropomorphic presentation to align with users' context-specific expectations regarding appropriate agent characteristics.
  - Citations: Jia et al. (2025), Elkhatibi (2024)


## Habit Formation and Long-Term Engagement Trajectories


### The Transition from Confirmation-Based to Habit-Based Continuance

While expectation-confirmation dynamics prove critical in shaping initial continuance intentions, sustained engagement increasingly depends on habit formation as users accumulate experience. Research on mobile short-video platforms reveals that perceived interactivity and perceived enjoyment, when integrated into expectation-confirmation theory, predict habit formation that sustains long-term usage. This suggests that expectation-confirmation dynamics in first interactions establish the foundation for habit development, which subsequently becomes the primary driver of continued engagement.
  - Citations: Choi et al. (2021)

The transition from confirmation-based to habit-based continuance represents a critical developmental trajectory. First interactions that generate strong confirmation and satisfaction create the conditions for repeated engagement, which gradually transitions into habitual use patterns. Over time, users' continuance intentions increasingly depend on habit strength rather than ongoing confirmation of expectations. This developmental perspective suggests that expectation-confirmation dynamics in first interactions prove consequential not merely for immediate continuance intentions but for establishing trajectories toward habitual engagement.
  - Citations: Choi et al. (2021)


### Effort Expectancy and Habit Development

Effort expectancy—users' perceptions regarding the ease of interaction with conversational agents—significantly influences both immediate confirmation experiences and longer-term habit formation. Research on restaurant recommendation chatbots reveals that effort expectancy represents a significant predictor of continued use intentions, while research on conversational agents for consumer services indicates that expected effort had no significant effect on adoption intentions. This variation suggests that effort expectancy's influence on continuance may depend on context-specific factors and the degree to which ease of use aligns with users' baseline expectations.
  - Citations: Romero-Charneco et al. (2025), Elkhatibi (2024)

The relationship between effort expectancy confirmation and habit formation appears particularly important. First interactions that confirm expectations for effortless interaction establish the low-friction conditions necessary for repeated engagement and subsequent habit formation. Conversely, first interactions that disconfirm effort expectations—requiring substantial cognitive or physical effort—may substantially impede the transition from confirmation-based to habit-based continuance.
  - Citations: Romero-Charneco et al. (2025)


## Quality Dimensions and Expectation-Confirmation in First Interactions


### Information Quality and Perceived Usefulness

Information quality represents a foundational dimension of expectation confirmation in chatbot interactions. Research on academic chatbot use reveals that perceived information quality demonstrates substantial positive correlation with confirmation, which subsequently influences continuance intentions. First interactions that deliver high-quality, accurate, relevant information substantially confirm users' expectations regarding chatbot utility and reliability.
  - Citations: Sari et al. (2024)

The relationship between information quality confirmation and perceived usefulness appears particularly consequential. When first interactions confirm expectations for high-quality information, users develop robust perceptions of the chatbot's usefulness, which substantially strengthens continuance intentions,. This quality-based confirmation mechanism suggests that first interactions must prioritize information accuracy and relevance to establish the cognitive foundation for sustained engagement.
  - Citations: Sari et al. (2024), Seddon (1996)


### System Quality and Interaction Fluency

System quality—encompassing interface design, response speed, and interaction fluency—significantly influences confirmation experiences in first interactions. Research on information systems success reveals that system quality substantially explains variance in user satisfaction. In chatbot contexts, system quality dimensions including response speed, interface intuitiveness, and interaction coherence substantially influence whether first interactions confirm or disconfirm user expectations,.
  - Citations: Seddon (1996), Nguyen et al. (2021), Jia et al. (2025)

First interactions that demonstrate high system quality—characterized by rapid response times, intuitive navigation, and coherent conversational flow—substantially confirm users' expectations regarding chatbot functionality and usability,. These system quality confirmations establish the technical foundation for continued engagement, as users develop confidence in the chatbot's capacity to deliver reliable, efficient service,.
  - Citations: Nguyen et al. (2021), Jia et al. (2025)


## Emotional Satisfaction and Affective Confirmation


### Emotional Versus Cognitive Satisfaction Dimensions

Research on pharmaceutical e-commerce chatbots reveals that both emotional and cognitive satisfaction positively influence continuance intentions. This distinction suggests that expectation-confirmation dynamics operate across multiple satisfaction dimensions simultaneously. First interactions that confirm expectations while generating positive emotional responses create more robust satisfaction than interactions that confirm expectations while generating neutral or negative affect.
  - Citations: Jia et al. (2025)

The emotional dimension of confirmation proves particularly important in contexts where users seek not merely functional performance but also positive emotional experiences. In mental health applications, for example, first interactions that confirm expectations for empathetic, supportive interaction while simultaneously generating positive emotional responses substantially strengthen continuance intentions,. This emotional confirmation mechanism suggests that first interactions must attend to affective dimensions of user experience, not merely cognitive or functional dimensions.
  - Citations: Fitzpatrick et al. (2017), Striegl et al. (2024)


### Perceived Enjoyment and Hedonic Confirmation

Perceived enjoyment represents a critical dimension of expectation confirmation, particularly in consumer-facing chatbot applications. Research on academic chatbot use reveals that perceived enjoyment demonstrates substantial positive correlation with satisfaction and continuance intentions. First interactions that confirm expectations for engaging, enjoyable interaction substantially increase the likelihood of continued engagement.
  - Citations: Sari et al. (2024)

The hedonic dimension of confirmation extends beyond mere entertainment value to encompass the intrinsic satisfaction derived from interaction itself. Users entering first interactions with conversational agents often harbor expectations regarding conversational quality, responsiveness, and engagement. When these hedonic expectations are confirmed, users develop positive affect that substantially strengthens continuance intentions,. This hedonic confirmation mechanism suggests that first interactions must balance functional performance with engaging, enjoyable interaction to maximize continuance intentions.
  - Citations: Sari et al. (2024), Romero-Charneco et al. (2025)


## Disconfirmation Effects and Negative Expectation Dynamics


### Negative Disconfirmation and Continuance Abandonment

While confirmation of expectations substantially strengthens continuance intentions, negative disconfirmation—where actual performance falls below expectations—substantially diminishes continued engagement. Research on chatbot services reveals that disconfirmation perceptions directly influence satisfaction and continuance intentions. First interactions that disconfirm expectations, particularly regarding critical performance dimensions, substantially reduce the likelihood of continued engagement.
  - Citations: Li et al. (2021)

The consequences of negative disconfirmation in first interactions appear particularly severe. Users who experience substantial disconfirmation in initial encounters develop skepticism regarding the chatbot's capabilities that may persist across subsequent interactions. This disconfirmation-based skepticism creates a negative feedback loop wherein users approach subsequent interactions with lower expectations and heightened critical scrutiny, making it increasingly difficult for the chatbot to generate positive confirmation experiences.
  - Citations: Li et al. (2021)


### Disclosure Effects and Expectation Manipulation

Research on chatbot disclosure reveals that informing users that they are interacting with artificial intelligence rather than human agents significantly influences expectation formation and subsequent confirmation experiences. Studies demonstrate that chatbot disclosure before conversation significantly reduces perceived knowledge and empathy, which subsequently decreases call length and purchase rates. This finding suggests that expectation formation in first interactions depends substantially on how users are primed regarding the nature of the agent they will encounter.
  - Citations: Luo et al. (2019)

The disclosure effect illustrates how initial expectations—shaped by information provided before interaction—fundamentally influence how users interpret confirmation experiences. Users informed that they are interacting with chatbots may develop lower expectations regarding empathy and knowledge, which may subsequently be more easily confirmed, or conversely, may develop skepticism that makes confirmation more difficult. This priming effect suggests that expectation-confirmation dynamics in first interactions depend substantially on the informational context within which interactions occur.
  - Citations: Luo et al. (2019)


## Switching Barriers and Confirmation Lock-In


### The Moderating Role of Switching Barriers

While expectation-confirmation dynamics directly influence continuance intentions, switching barriers—costs and obstacles associated with discontinuing service—substantially moderate this relationship. Research on customer retention reveals that switching barriers have both significant positive effects on customer retention and moderating effects on the relationship between satisfaction and retention. This suggests that even when confirmation experiences generate only moderate satisfaction, high switching barriers may sustain continued engagement.
  - Citations: Ranaweera (2003)

The interaction between confirmation and switching barriers creates complex continuance dynamics. Users experiencing strong confirmation and high satisfaction will continue engagement regardless of switching barriers, while users experiencing weak confirmation but facing high switching barriers may continue engagement despite low satisfaction. First interactions that generate strong confirmation experiences prove particularly valuable in contexts with low switching barriers, where users can easily discontinue service if dissatisfied.
  - Citations: Ranaweera (2003)


### Trust Erosion and Switching Intention

Research on service recovery reveals that even satisfying service recovery processes may prove inadequate to prevent loss of trust, with significant implications for future consumer behavior. This finding suggests that negative disconfirmation experiences in first interactions may generate trust erosion that persists even when subsequent interactions confirm expectations. First interactions that disconfirm expectations regarding trustworthiness may establish trust deficits that substantially impede continued engagement, even when later interactions demonstrate improved performance.
  - Citations: Ranaweera (2003)


## Measurement and Assessment of Expectation-Confirmation Dynamics


### Real-Time Satisfaction Assessment

Measuring expectation-confirmation dynamics in first interactions requires sophisticated approaches to capturing evolving satisfaction and confirmation perceptions. Research on customer satisfaction estimation in conversational agents reveals that measuring and adapting to customer satisfaction is critical for understanding user perception and increasing engagement and retention. Real-time assessment approaches allow conversational systems to adapt dynamically during interactions, with remediation strategies including response adjustment or escalation to human operators.
  - Citations: Kim et al. (2020), Kohli (2025)

The capacity to measure confirmation and satisfaction in real-time during first interactions enables dynamic adaptation that can substantially enhance confirmation experiences. When conversational agents detect disconfirmation or declining satisfaction during initial interactions, they can implement remediation strategies that restore confirmation and prevent negative disconfirmation from establishing persistent skepticism,. This real-time measurement and adaptation approach suggests that first interactions need not be static; rather, they can be dynamically optimized to maximize confirmation experiences.
  - Citations: Kim et al. (2020), Kohli (2025)


### Structural Equation Modeling and Confirmation Pathways

Empirical research on expectation-confirmation dynamics predominantly employs structural equation modeling to test theoretical pathways. Studies across multiple chatbot contexts consistently demonstrate that confirmation significantly predicts satisfaction, which subsequently predicts continuance intention,,. This consistent pathway across diverse contexts suggests robust theoretical relationships between expectation-confirmation dynamics and continued engagement.
  - Citations: Sari et al. (2024), Nguyen et al. (2021), Li et al. (2021)

The structural equation modeling approach enables researchers to simultaneously examine direct effects of confirmation on continuance intention and indirect effects mediated through satisfaction,,. Findings consistently reveal that satisfaction mediates a substantial portion of confirmation's effect on continuance intention, while confirmation also demonstrates direct effects on continuance intention,,. This dual-pathway mechanism suggests that expectation-confirmation dynamics influence continued engagement through both satisfaction-based and direct cognitive pathways.
  - Citations: Sari et al. (2024), Nguyen et al. (2021), Li et al. (2021)


## Implications for Chatbot Design and Implementation


### Expectation Management in Initial Interactions

Understanding expectation-confirmation dynamics in first interactions has substantial implications for chatbot design and implementation. Organizations deploying conversational agents should carefully manage user expectations in pre-interaction contexts, ensuring that users enter first interactions with realistic, achievable expectations. Overstating chatbot capabilities or anthropomorphic qualities in marketing materials may generate expectations that first interactions cannot confirm, leading to negative disconfirmation and reduced continuance intentions.
  - Citations: Luo et al. (2019)

Effective expectation management requires transparent communication regarding chatbot capabilities, limitations, and appropriate use cases. Users who enter first interactions with accurate expectations regarding what conversational agents can and cannot accomplish are more likely to experience confirmation, as their expectations align with realistic performance parameters. This expectation calibration approach suggests that pre-interaction communication represents a critical component of maximizing confirmation experiences in first interactions.
  - Citations: Luo et al. (2019)


### Performance Optimization for Confirmation

First interactions should prioritize performance dimensions most critical to users' baseline expectations. In banking contexts, this means emphasizing security and transactional accuracy; in mental health contexts, this means emphasizing empathetic responsiveness and emotional support; in e-commerce contexts, this means emphasizing product knowledge and recommendation quality,,,. By concentrating resources on confirming users' highest-priority expectations in first interactions, organizations can maximize the likelihood of generating robust confirmation experiences that sustain continued engagement.
  - Citations: Sari et al. (2024), Nguyen et al. (2021), Fitzpatrick et al. (2017), Eren (2021)

The performance optimization approach suggests that first interactions need not demonstrate excellence across all dimensions; rather, they should demonstrate reliable, high-quality performance on dimensions most critical to users' expectations,,. This prioritization approach enables organizations to allocate resources efficiently while maximizing confirmation experiences in first interactions.
  - Citations: Sari et al. (2024), Nguyen et al. (2021), Eren (2021)


### Emotional Engagement and Affective Confirmation

First interactions should attend to emotional dimensions of user experience alongside functional performance. Conversational agents should be designed to generate positive affect through engaging conversational style, appropriate emotional responsiveness, and supportive language,,. These affective dimensions of first interactions substantially influence whether confirmation experiences translate into robust satisfaction and continuance intentions,,.
  - Citations: Sari et al. (2024), Fitzpatrick et al. (2017), Striegl et al. (2024)

The emotional engagement approach suggests that first interactions should balance functional performance with relational quality. Users who experience both functional confirmation (e.g., accurate information) and emotional confirmation (e.g., supportive, engaging interaction) develop more robust satisfaction and stronger continuance intentions than users who experience functional confirmation alone,,.
  - Citations: Sari et al. (2024), Fitzpatrick et al. (2017), Striegl et al. (2024)


### Adaptation and Remediation Strategies

First interactions should incorporate real-time assessment and adaptation mechanisms that enable conversational agents to detect disconfirmation or declining satisfaction and implement remediation strategies,. When agents detect that users' expectations are not being confirmed, they can adjust response strategies, provide additional information, or escalate to human operators,. These dynamic adaptation approaches can substantially enhance confirmation experiences in first interactions by preventing negative disconfirmation from establishing persistent skepticism.
  - Citations: Kim et al. (2020), Kohli (2025)


## Limitations and Future Research Directions


### Context-Specific Variations and Generalizability

While research on expectation-confirmation dynamics in chatbot contexts demonstrates consistent theoretical pathways, substantial variations exist across different application domains. Mental health applications, banking services, e-commerce, and academic support contexts all demonstrate expectation-confirmation effects, but the specific expectations users bring to these contexts vary substantially,,,. Future research should more thoroughly examine how context-specific expectations influence confirmation experiences and continuance intentions across diverse chatbot applications.
  - Citations: Sari et al. (2024), Nguyen et al. (2021), Fitzpatrick et al. (2017), Eren (2021)


### Individual Differences and Personalization

Research on expectation-confirmation dynamics has begun examining individual differences in technology anxiety and AI hesitancy, but substantial opportunities exist for more comprehensive examination of how individual characteristics influence confirmation experiences. Users with different technology backgrounds, cultural orientations, and personal preferences likely bring different expectations to first interactions and interpret confirmation experiences differently. Future research should examine how personalization approaches can calibrate first interactions to individual users' expectations and preferences, thereby maximizing confirmation experiences.
  - Citations: Li et al. (2024)


### Long-Term Engagement Trajectories

While research has examined the transition from confirmation-based to habit-based continuance, substantial opportunities exist for longitudinal research examining how expectation-confirmation dynamics in first interactions influence long-term engagement trajectories. Do first interactions that generate strong confirmation experiences establish trajectories toward sustained engagement, or do subsequent interactions substantially reshape continuance intentions? How do confirmation experiences in first interactions influence users' expectations for subsequent interactions? These questions require longitudinal research designs that track users across multiple interactions over extended periods.
  - Citations: Choi et al. (2021)


### Negative Disconfirmation Recovery

Research has identified that negative disconfirmation in first interactions substantially reduces continuance intentions, but limited research has examined whether and how organizations can recover from negative disconfirmation experiences. Can subsequent interactions that demonstrate improved performance overcome negative disconfirmation from first interactions? What remediation strategies prove most effective for restoring user confidence after negative disconfirmation? Future research should examine recovery mechanisms that enable organizations to sustain engagement despite negative first-interaction experiences.
  - Citations: Li et al. (2021)


## Conclusion

Expectation-confirmation dynamics in first interactions represent a critical determinant of continued engagement with conversational agents and chatbots. Users enter first interactions with specific expectations regarding performance, reliability, emotional support, and interaction quality. When these expectations are confirmed through actual performance, users develop satisfaction and trust that substantially strengthen continuance intentions,,,. Conversely, negative disconfirmation in first interactions substantially diminishes the likelihood of continued engagement,.
  - Citations: Bhattacherjee (2001), Sari et al. (2024), Nguyen et al. (2021), Li et al. (2021), Luo et al. (2019)

The relationship between expectation-confirmation dynamics and continuance intention operates through multiple pathways. Confirmation directly influences satisfaction, which subsequently predicts continuance intention,,. Confirmation also demonstrates direct effects on continuance intention, suggesting that cognitive confirmation experiences influence continued engagement independent of satisfaction-based mechanisms,,. These dual pathways indicate that expectation-confirmation dynamics influence continued engagement through both affective and cognitive mechanisms.
  - Citations: Sari et al. (2024), Nguyen et al. (2021), Li et al. (2021)

Context-specific variations substantially influence how expectation-confirmation dynamics shape continued engagement. In mental health applications, confirmation of expectations for empathetic, supportive interaction proves particularly consequential,; in banking contexts, confirmation of security and transactional accuracy expectations proves critical,; in e-commerce contexts, confirmation of both utilitarian and hedonic expectations influences continuance,. These context-specific patterns suggest that organizations must understand domain-specific expectations and prioritize confirmation of expectations most critical to their users.
  - Citations: Fitzpatrick et al. (2017), Striegl et al. (2024), Nguyen et al. (2021), Eren (2021), Sari et al. (2024), Romero-Charneco et al. (2025)

First interactions represent a critical juncture in users' engagement trajectories with conversational agents. The confirmation experiences generated in first interactions establish the foundation for subsequent engagement, influence habit formation trajectories, and shape long-term continuance intentions,. Organizations deploying conversational agents should therefore invest substantial resources in optimizing first interactions to maximize confirmation experiences, manage user expectations realistically, and attend to both functional and emotional dimensions of user experience.
  - Citations: Sari et al. (2024), Choi et al. (2021)

Future research should examine how expectation-confirmation dynamics vary across diverse user populations and application contexts, investigate mechanisms for recovering from negative disconfirmation experiences, and employ longitudinal designs to understand how first-interaction confirmation experiences influence long-term engagement trajectories. As conversational agents become increasingly prevalent across diverse sectors, understanding the expectation-confirmation dynamics that sustain engagement will prove increasingly critical for organizations seeking to maximize user retention and satisfaction.

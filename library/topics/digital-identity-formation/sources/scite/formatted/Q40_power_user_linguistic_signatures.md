# Linguistic Features Distinguishing Expert and Novice Users in Human-Computer Interaction Contexts


## Introduction

The distinction between expert and novice users in human-computer interaction (HCI) contexts manifests through observable linguistic and behavioral patterns that reflect underlying cognitive differences in how users conceptualize, articulate, and execute their interactions with computational systems. This synthesis examines the linguistic features that characterize expertise across various HCI domains, including command-line interfaces, search engines, and software interfaces, while exploring whether universal signatures of mastery exist across these contexts.


## Linguistic Features in Search Engine Interactions


### Query Formulation and Reformulation Strategies

One of the most well-documented linguistic distinctions between expert and novice users emerges in search engine contexts, particularly in how users formulate and reformulate their queries. Research has demonstrated that participants with less expertise in information searching more frequently rely on reformulation term suggestions provided by search engines, whereas expert users demonstrate greater autonomy in their query construction. This finding suggests that novice users exhibit linguistic dependency on system-generated suggestions, while experts possess the semantic vocabulary and domain knowledge necessary to independently construct effective queries.

The reliance on system suggestions among novices indicates a fundamental difference in linguistic self-sufficiency. Expert users demonstrate what might be termed "linguistic autonomy"—the ability to generate precise, domain-appropriate terminology without external scaffolding. This autonomy reflects deeper semantic knowledge structures that enable experts to translate their information needs into effective query language.

### Semantic Precision and Domain Vocabulary

The distinction between expert and novice query behavior extends beyond mere suggestion usage to encompass the semantic precision of query terms. Modern search engines and information retrieval tools increasingly leverage Knowledge Graphs to enable more powerful semantic matching between queries and results. Expert users appear better equipped to exploit these semantic capabilities through their use of precise, domain-specific terminology that aligns with underlying knowledge structures.

## Command-Line Interface Expertise


### Technical Vocabulary and Syntactic Complexity

Command-line interfaces represent a particularly demanding HCI context where linguistic expertise directly correlates with functional capability. The transition from command-line interfaces to graphical integrated development environments (IDEs) and from low-level to high-level programming languages has historically represented efforts to improve usability and reduce the linguistic barriers to software development. This evolution acknowledges that command-line proficiency requires specialized technical expertise that creates barriers for those without programming skills.
  - Citations: Krings (2025)

Expert command-line users demonstrate mastery through their ability to construct syntactically complex commands that chain multiple operations. For instance, tools like bcftools provide powerful command-line interfaces, but developing custom analyses requires either expertise in C programming or the ability to combine multiple options and sub-commands effectively. This suggests that expert users possess not only vocabulary knowledge but also syntactic competence—the ability to combine commands in grammatically correct and functionally effective sequences.

### Abstraction and Efficiency in Command Construction

The linguistic signatures of command-line expertise include the ability to work at appropriate levels of abstraction. Research on bioinformatics tools notes that command-line interface-based pipeline frameworks present challenges that have motivated the development of GUI-based workbenches. The challenges inherent in command-line work include the need to specify goals, requirements, and constraints using precise linguistic formulations. Expert users demonstrate the ability to translate high-level objectives into low-level command sequences, a form of linguistic translation that requires both domain knowledge and syntactic fluency.

Similarly, the transition of metabolomics software XCMS from a command-line interface requiring expertise with the R programming language to a web-based platform with a graphical user interface illustrates the linguistic demands placed on command-line users. Expert users of such systems must possess programming language fluency that enables them to express complex analytical operations through textual commands.

## Software Interface Interactions


### Linguistic Patterns in User Experience

The study of ordinary user experiences at work has drawn attention to the mundane, unremarkable, and ordinary interactions that characterize everyday software use. This research perspective suggests that expertise may manifest not only in exceptional performance but also in the linguistic patterns that characterize routine interactions. Expert users may demonstrate linguistic efficiency—accomplishing tasks with minimal verbal or textual overhead—while novices may exhibit more exploratory or uncertain linguistic patterns.

### Expertise in Specialized Software Domains

In specialized software contexts, the distinction between expert and novice users often correlates with domain-specific linguistic competence. Research on expert finding systems demonstrates that expertise can be detected and characterized through linguistic analysis of user-generated content. These systems leverage semantic approaches to match technical knowledge with domain expertise, suggesting that linguistic output serves as a reliable indicator of underlying expertise.

The development of knowledge patterns for online health portal development illustrates how linguistic expertise intersects with domain knowledge in software contexts. These patterns integrate language technology approaches with user studies of portal interaction, demonstrating that effective software use requires both technical linguistic competence and domain-appropriate vocabulary.

## Universal Signatures of Mastery


### Cross-Domain Linguistic Indicators

Several linguistic features appear to transcend specific HCI contexts and may represent universal signatures of mastery:

Semantic Precision: Across search engines, command-line interfaces, and software applications, expert users consistently demonstrate the ability to select precise, domain-appropriate terminology. This precision reduces ambiguity and increases the efficiency of human-computer communication,.
  - Citations: Monchaux et al. (2015), Cifariello et al. (2019)

Syntactic Complexity and Fluency: Expert users demonstrate the ability to construct complex, multi-part commands or queries that chain operations effectively. This syntactic fluency appears in command-line contexts,and in search query formulation.
  - Citations: Pedersen (2017), Kanwal et al. (2017), Monchaux et al. (2015)

Reduced Reliance on System Scaffolding: A consistent finding across contexts is that expert users require less support from system-generated suggestions, help systems, or simplified interfaces,,.
  - Citations: Monchaux et al. (2015), Krings (2025), Rinehart et al. (2014)

Linguistic Autonomy: Expert users demonstrate the ability to independently generate effective linguistic formulations without external assistance, reflecting internalized knowledge structures that enable direct translation of intentions into system-appropriate language.
  - Citations: Monchaux et al. (2015)


### The Role of Domain Knowledge

The relationship between linguistic expertise and domain knowledge appears bidirectional. Domain knowledge enables the acquisition of specialized vocabulary and syntactic patterns, while linguistic competence facilitates deeper engagement with domain content. Research on information searching demonstrates that prior domain knowledge affects query strategies and the complexity of information problems that users can effectively address.
  - Citations: Monchaux et al. (2015)

This interdependence suggests that universal signatures of mastery may be better understood as domain-general linguistic capabilities (precision, complexity, autonomy) that are instantiated through domain-specific vocabulary and conventions. The underlying cognitive processes may be universal, while their surface manifestations vary across HCI contexts.


### Barriers to Expertise Development

The linguistic demands of expert-level HCI performance create barriers that have motivated significant interface design efforts. The lack of required teaching expertise, computer literacy, programming language knowledge, or command-line proficiency represents significant obstacles for users attempting to engage with complex computational tools. These barriers highlight the linguistic nature of expertise—mastery requires not only conceptual understanding but also the linguistic competence to express that understanding in system-appropriate forms.

## Implications for Interface Design and User Support


### Reducing Linguistic Barriers

The recognition that linguistic features distinguish expert from novice users has motivated interface design approaches that reduce linguistic demands. The development of by-example syntactic search engines allows users to execute syntactic queries based on example sentences rather than requiring explicit linguistic expertise. Users can indicate their intentions through light markup of example sentences, with the system automatically translating this markup into syntactic patterns. This approach represents an attempt to bridge the linguistic gap between novice intentions and expert-level query formulation.

### Supporting Linguistic Development

Understanding the linguistic signatures of expertise can inform the design of systems that support users' progression from novice to expert status. By identifying the specific linguistic features that characterize expert performance—semantic precision, syntactic complexity, reduced reliance on scaffolding—systems can be designed to gradually develop these capabilities in users.


## Conclusions

The linguistic features distinguishing expert from novice users in HCI contexts include semantic precision in terminology selection, syntactic complexity in command and query construction, and reduced reliance on system-generated suggestions and scaffolding. These features appear across command-line interfaces, search engines, and software applications, suggesting the existence of universal signatures of mastery that transcend specific technological contexts.

However, these universal signatures are instantiated through domain-specific vocabulary and conventions, indicating that expertise development requires both domain-general linguistic capabilities and domain-specific knowledge acquisition. The bidirectional relationship between linguistic competence and domain knowledge suggests that supporting expertise development requires attention to both dimensions.

Future research should continue to examine the linguistic patterns that characterize expert performance across diverse HCI contexts, with particular attention to how these patterns develop over time and how interface design can support their acquisition. The recognition that linguistic features serve as reliable indicators of expertise has implications for user modeling, adaptive interface design, and the development of training systems that support users' progression toward mastery.

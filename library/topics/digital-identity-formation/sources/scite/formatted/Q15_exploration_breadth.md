# Exploration Breadth and Feature Adoption Breadth as Correlates and Predictors of Platform Stickiness


## Introduction

Platform stickiness—defined as a digital platform's ability to retain customers by keeping them engaged and encouraging repeat visits—has emerged as a critical success factor in the digital economy. While extensive research has examined various antecedents of stickiness, the specific role of exploration breadth and feature adoption breadth remains an understudied area within the academic literature. This review synthesizes available evidence to assess how breadth of feature exploration and adoption has been investigated as a correlate or predictor of platform stickiness.


## Defining Platform Stickiness and Its Importance

Platform stickiness encompasses multiple dimensions of user engagement and retention. In the mobile app context, stickiness portrays a user's behavioral intention of re-usage and prolonged engagement with the mobile app. The critical significance of online stickiness stems from the dynamic interactions between users and digital platforms, particularly as they evolve through the integration of advanced digital technologies. Stickiness is measured through various indicators, including the duration of time spent by users on a site, which can serve as an indicator of users' attitude toward or level of dependency on the products or services portrayed on the platform.

## Feature Characteristics and Platform Engagement

Research has identified that user perceptions of mobile app characteristics significantly influence platform stickiness. Kim et al. investigated how user perceptions of mobile app characteristics relate to post-adoption behaviors, finding that perceived ubiquity, perceived informativeness, and perceived personalization are positively associated with mobile app usefulness, thereby leading to enhanced stickiness and word of mouth. This suggests that the breadth of features users perceive as useful and informative may contribute to their continued engagement with platforms.

Similarly, perceived interactivity has been identified as a significant influence on consumer attitudes toward mobile social media platforms, with consumer attitudes being the most significant predictor of consumer belongingness and stickiness. The incorporation of social media features to improve users' parasocial interaction positively influenced stickiness, demonstrating that the phenomenon of parasocial interaction in human relationships also exists between users and mobile apps. These findings suggest that platforms offering diverse interactive features may enhance user engagement through multiple pathways.

## Design Features and User Engagement

The relationship between design features and stickiness has been examined in the mobile application context. Martinez and Mcandrews found that while arousal was a significant mediator of mobile design features' influence on stickiness intentions, mobile design features alone were not a direct significant predictor of stickiness intentions. This suggests that the relationship between feature breadth and stickiness may be mediated by emotional responses rather than being direct.

## Behavioral Engagement and Continuance

Continuance motivation and sharing behavior have been identified as having positive and significant impacts on stickiness. Users who continuously share content on platforms are less likely to leave the site, suggesting that active engagement with platform features—including sharing and content creation capabilities—contributes to platform retention. This behavioral dimension of feature adoption may represent a form of exploration breadth, wherein users who engage with multiple platform functionalities demonstrate higher stickiness.

## Perceived Value and Feature Utilization

Perceived value dimensions have been shown to have positive effects on user stickiness. The breadth of features that users perceive as valuable—whether hedonic or utilitarian in nature—may influence their continued platform use. Nandi et al. emphasized that perceived value in the mobile app context is particularly important, as mobile app stickiness garners greater importance than its website counterpart due to the complex nature of the interaction between users and a combination of mobile devices and apps when conjugated with robust mobile platforms.

## Research Gaps and Limitations

Despite the growing interest in platform stickiness, the scholarly work remains divergent, partial, and fragmented. While research has examined various antecedents of stickiness—including trust, personalization, interactivity, and design features—there is a notable absence of direct empirical investigation into how exploration breadth or feature adoption breadth specifically functions as a correlate or predictor of platform stickiness.

The available literature suggests that features and their characteristics matter for stickiness, but the breadth of feature exploration or adoption has not been systematically studied as a distinct construct. Most research focuses on specific feature characteristics (such as personalization, informativeness, or interactivity) rather than examining the breadth of features users explore or adopt across a platform. This represents a significant gap in the literature, as the quantity and diversity of features users engage with may represent an important but understudied dimension of platform engagement.


## Theoretical Implications

The synthesis of available evidence suggests that feature breadth may operate through multiple mechanisms to influence stickiness. First, broader feature adoption may increase perceived value by providing users with more tools to accomplish their goals. Second, exploration of diverse features may enhance emotional engagement through arousal and positive affect. Third, breadth of feature use may facilitate social connection and parasocial interaction, which have been shown to influence stickiness,. Fourth, users who explore multiple features may develop stronger habits and continuance motivation, leading to a reduced likelihood of platform abandonment.

## Conclusion

While exploration breadth and feature adoption breadth have not been directly and systematically studied as correlates or predictors of platform stickiness in the academic literature, the available evidence suggests these constructs warrant investigation. Research on related constructs—including feature characteristics, perceived value, interactivity, and behavioral engagement—indicates that the breadth of features users explore and adopt likely influences platform stickiness through multiple pathways. Future research should directly examine exploration breadth and feature adoption breadth as distinct constructs, investigating their direct and mediated effects on platform stickiness across different platform types and user populations.

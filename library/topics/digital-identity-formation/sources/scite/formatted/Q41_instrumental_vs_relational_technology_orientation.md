# Individual Difference Measures of Instrumental versus Relational Orientation Toward Technology: Stability, Context-Dependence, and Predictive Validity


## Introduction

Understanding how individuals approach technology—whether primarily as a tool for accomplishing tasks (instrumental orientation) or as a medium for social connection and relationship maintenance (relational orientation)—represents a critical area of inquiry in human-computer interaction and information systems research. This distinction parallels broader psychological constructs related to independent versus interdependent self-construal and analytic versus holistic cognitive styles that have been extensively studied in cross-cultural psychology,. The question of whether these orientations represent stable individual traits or context-dependent states has significant implications for predicting technology use patterns and designing interventions to promote healthy technology engagement.

## Theoretical Foundations: Independence-Interdependence and Cognitive Style Frameworks


### Cultural and Individual Differences in Social Orientation

The foundational work on independent versus interdependent self-construal provides a theoretical basis for understanding instrumental versus relational technology orientations. Markus and Kitayamaestablished that American culture emphasizes attending to the self and discovering unique inner attributes, while other cultures prioritize attending to others, fitting in, and harmonious interdependence. This fundamental distinction between independence (viewing oneself as disconnected from others) and interdependence (viewing oneself as embedded in relations with others) has been validated across multiple measures at the group level.

However, the relationship between cultural-level differences and individual-level variation is complex. Na et al.demonstrated through a large-scale study with multiple measures of independent versus interdependent social orientation that "differences in social orientation and in cognition that exist between cultures and social classes do not necessarily have counterparts in individual differences within those groups." This finding has profound implications for measuring instrumental versus relational technology orientations, suggesting that group-level cultural patterns may not translate directly into individual difference measures.

### Cognitive Style Dimensions

Cognitive style represents another dimension relevant to technology orientation. Research has examined analytic versus holistic cognitive styles, with analytic thinking associated with independent social orientation and holistic thinking with interdependent orientation,. Kitayama et al.found that across implicit indicators of independence, Japanese participants were substantially less independent (or more interdependent) than Western groups, though explicit self-belief measures showed anomalous patterns. This dissociation between implicit and explicit measures suggests that technology orientation assessments may need to incorporate both measurement approaches.

Importantly, Marquez and Ellwangerfound that "independent and interdependent self-construals do not predict analytic or holistic reasoning," indicating that the hypothesis linking collectivism and individualism with differences in information processing between individuals requires further scrutiny. This challenges simplistic assumptions about how social orientation translates into cognitive processing styles that might influence technology use.

## Measurement Approaches and Instruments


### Embodiment and Integration Measures

Nelson et al.developed and validated a wearable technology embodiment instrument that captures the degree to which technology becomes integrated into one's sense of self. To test predictive validity, they utilized dependent variables related to technology adoption including trust, involvement, and perceived usefulness. This embodiment construct may capture aspects of relational orientation toward technology, where devices become extensions of social identity rather than mere tools.
  - Citations: Nelson et al. (2019)


### Cognitive Style Assessments in Technology Contexts

Kasim and Annuarestablished a conceptual framework for measuring cognitive styles in predicting technology acceptance, integrating the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology with psychology-cognitive styles to examine their role in influencing portal usage. Their work suggests that cognitive style measures can be adapted to technology contexts, though the validity of such adaptations requires careful examination.
  - Citations: Kasim (2011)

Ask et al.examined cognitive flexibility and cognitive styles in relation to technology-mediated tasks (specifically deepfake detection). Their findings revealed that cognitive flexibility showed significant associations with both performance and metacognitive accuracy, suggesting that flexible cognitive orientations may be more predictive of technology-related outcomes than traditional cognitive style measures.
  - Citations: Ask et al. (2023)


### Causality Orientations

Self-determination theory offers another measurement framework through causality orientations. Blevins et al.found that "autonomy and controlled orientations were associated with readiness to change," suggesting that both autonomous and controlled orientations have implications for behavioral outcomes. These orientations may parallel instrumental (controlled, externally motivated) versus relational (autonomous, intrinsically motivated) approaches to technology use.

## Stability versus Context-Dependence


### Evidence for Trait-Like Stability

Research on social orientation and cognitive style provides mixed evidence regarding stability. Na et al.examined "within-person stability in interdependent (vs. independent) social orientation and holistic (vs. analytic) cognitive style," demonstrating that the dissociation between group and individual-level processes holds across comprehensive measure sets. Their finding of "negligible interindividual correlations between social orientation measures as well as between cognitive style measures" suggests that these constructs may not function as stable, coherent individual difference dimensions.
  - Citations: Na et al. (2019)

Grossmann and Nanoted that "social orientation and cognitive style can be studied not only by looking at the individual but also at cultural products and practices," emphasizing that priming effects can activate knowledge about behavioral patterns associated with different orientations "even without one's conscious awareness." This malleability suggests significant context-dependence.
  - Citations: Grossmann (2013)


### Context-Dependent Activation

The priming literature demonstrates that orientations can shift based on situational cues. Grossmann and Naemphasized that priming studies reveal "the availability of knowledge about behavioral patterns associated with interdependent social orientation or holistic cognitive style to individuals from cultures that habitually show independent social orientation or analytic cognitive style (and vice versa)." This bidirectional accessibility indicates that instrumental and relational orientations may coexist within individuals and be differentially activated by context.
  - Citations: Grossmann (2013)

Shlomfound that social comparison orientation (SCO) showed "a significant inverse relationship with psychological well-being, and this relationship was not moderated by engagement type." This suggests that certain individual psychological traits "may have a broader and more consistent influence on digital well-being than specific behavioral patterns of use," pointing toward trait-like stability for some orientation measures.
  - Citations: Shlom (2025)


### Methodological Considerations

Henrich et al.raised fundamental concerns about generalizing psychological findings, noting that "many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior—hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation." This caution applies directly to technology orientation measures, which may show different stability patterns across populations.

## Prediction of Technology Use Patterns


### Continuance and Adoption Behaviors

Bhattacherjeeestablished that "users' continuance intention is determined by their satisfaction with IS use and perceived usefulness of continued IS use," with satisfaction influenced by "confirmation of expectation from prior IS use and perceived usefulness." This expectation-confirmation model suggests that instrumental orientations (focused on usefulness) strongly predict continued technology engagement.
  - Citations: Bhattacherjee (2001)

Yang et al.examined task-oriented artificial intelligence device adoption, revealing "the underlying psychological mechanism when customers use task-oriented AI devices" and providing "a theoretical framework for task-oriented AI device adoption." This work specifically addresses instrumental orientation toward technology and its predictive validity for adoption behaviors.
  - Citations: Yang et al. (2022)


### Engagement Patterns and Well-Being Outcomes

Shlomexamined passive versus active social media engagement, finding that "passive use did not predict lower well-being, and neither active-social nor active non-social use showed meaningful effects." The results "point to the complexity of digital engagement and the necessity of going beyond narrow assumptions about screen time or engagement type." This complexity suggests that simple instrumental-relational distinctions may inadequately capture the multidimensional nature of technology engagement.
  - Citations: Shlom (2025)

Contractor et al.identified the role of "process-oriented smartphone feature uses (e.g., watching videos/TV/movies, reading books/magazines, games) in the relation between PTSD symptoms and problematic smartphone use." Their findings suggest that orientation toward technology (process-oriented versus goal-oriented) predicts problematic use patterns, with implications for intervention design.
  - Citations: Contractor et al. (2018)


### Attachment and Interpersonal Orientations

Hawley et al.investigated whether "adults' attachment orientations are related to involvement of others in goal strategies in social contexts," finding that "attachment confidence will predict prosocial strategies (e.g., reciprocation, cooperation), while avoidance will predict use of coercive strategies (e.g., instrumental aggression)." This framework suggests that attachment orientations may underlie instrumental versus relational technology use, with secure attachment promoting relational engagement and avoidant attachment promoting instrumental use.
  - Citations: Hawley et al. (2009)

López-Fernández et al.examined "perceptions underlying addictive technology use patterns," assessing "internet problems and attachment styles" and finding prevalence rates for self-reported addictions varying from "1.2% (gaming) to 2.7% (social networking)." The association between attachment styles and problematic use patterns supports the relevance of relational orientation measures for predicting technology-related outcomes.

## Integration and Synthesis


### The Complexity of Individual Differences

The evidence suggests that instrumental versus relational technology orientations cannot be captured by single measures but require multidimensional assessment approaches. Na et al.demonstrated that cultural differences in social orientation and cognition "do not necessarily have counterparts in individual differences within those groups," challenging the assumption that group-level constructs translate directly into individual difference measures. This finding is reinforced by the observation of negligible correlations between different measures of the same theoretical construct.
  - Citations: Na et al. (2010), Na et al. (2019)


### Implicit versus Explicit Measurement

Kitayama et al.found that implicit indicators of independence showed consistent cultural patterns while "an explicit self-belief measure of independence and interdependence showed an anomalous pattern." Similarly, Martín et al.noted that their findings "are quite consistent with previous work using implicit tests of analytic (vs. holistic) cognition, in which implicit measures were largely unrelated to explicit measures of self-construal." This dissociation suggests that technology orientation assessments should incorporate both implicit and explicit measures to capture the full construct.
  - Citations: Kitayama et al. (2009), Mart (2019)


### Predictive Validity Considerations

The predictive validity of orientation measures depends on the outcome of interest. For technology adoption and continuance, instrumental factors like perceived usefulness show strong predictive power,. For well-being outcomes, individual traits like social comparison orientation may be more predictive than behavioral engagement patterns. For problematic use, attachment orientations and process-oriented engagement patterns show significant associations,.

## Conclusions and Future Directions

The measurement of instrumental versus relational orientation toward technology remains a complex endeavor. Current evidence suggests that these orientations are neither purely stable traits nor entirely context-dependent states, but rather represent accessible knowledge structures that can be differentially activated by situational cues. The negligible correlations between different measures of social orientation and cognitive style at the individual levelindicate that comprehensive assessment requires multiple measurement approaches.

Future research should heed the methodological cautions raised by Henrich et al.regarding the generalizability of findings from narrow population samples. Additionally, the development of technology-specific orientation measures, such as the wearable technology embodiment instrument, represents a promising direction for capturing the unique aspects of human-technology relationships. The integration of implicit and explicit measures, attention to context-dependent activation, and recognition of the multidimensional nature of technology engagement will be essential for advancing this field.

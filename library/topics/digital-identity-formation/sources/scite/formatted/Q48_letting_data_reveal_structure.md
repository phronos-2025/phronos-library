# Precedents for Data-Driven Structure Discovery in Psychology, HCI, and Communication Research


## Introduction

The tension between theory-driven and data-driven approaches represents a fundamental methodological consideration across the behavioral and social sciences. As research domains become increasingly characterized by complex, high-dimensional datasets, scholars have explored approaches that allow empirical data to reveal underlying structures rather than imposing predetermined theoretical frameworks. This synthesis examines the precedents for such "letting data reveal structure" approaches across psychology, human-computer interaction (HCI), and communication research, while also addressing the conditions under which these approaches may be preferable to theory-driven feature selection.


## Historical Context and the Theory-Data Tension

The behavioral sciences have traditionally been characterized by a predominantly data-driven orientation, though this has not always been viewed favorably. Kruglanski and Higginsobserve that "one reason that our field is predominantly data driven rather than theory driven has to do with the nature of our graduate training in social personality psychology," noting that while the field has excelled at teaching phenomena discovery and data analytic techniques, it has "fallen short in providing them with the kind of training that would help them in their theory-construction efforts". This observation highlights a longstanding tension in the field regarding the appropriate balance between empirical discovery and theoretical guidance.

However, the emergence of computational methods and big data has fundamentally transformed this landscape. Chen and Wojcikargue that "the massive volume of data that now covers a wide variety of human behaviors offers researchers in psychology an unprecedented opportunity to conduct innovative theory- and data-driven field research." Their practical guide to big data research explicitly covers both supervised and unsupervised learning methods, acknowledging that data-driven discovery approaches have become legitimate and valuable methodological tools in psychological research.

## Precedents in Psychology


### Psychological Network Analysis

One of the most prominent contemporary examples of data-driven structure discovery in psychology is psychological network analysis. Doornwaard et al.demonstrate this approach in their investigation of problematic social media use, where "psychological network analysis identifies self-esteem, attention problems, impulsivity, depressive symptoms, and life satisfaction as the central nodes most strongly connected in networks." Their findings reveal that "theory- and data-driven approaches emphasize different factors involved in the emergence of at-risk/problematic SMU among adolescents, illuminating how psychological network analysis can be used to generate novel hypotheses about causal processes". This work exemplifies how data-driven methods can complement and extend theoretical understanding by revealing structural relationships that may not be apparent from theory alone.

### Deep Learning and Behavioral Clustering

Recent advances in machine learning have enabled increasingly sophisticated data-driven approaches to psychological classification. Munshidescribes a deep learning approach to consumer behavior analysis that "begins with systematic data preprocessing and feature engineering, creating engagement, diversity, and loyalty indices as proxies for psychological traits derived from behavioral data." The methodology employs autoencoders to "compress high-dimensional representations to capture the latent space underlying consumer behavior patterns," with the resulting model segmenting "consumers into five distinct archetypes, each assessed using internal clustering measures and mapped to Big Five personality traits". This approach demonstrates how data-driven dimensionality reduction can reveal psychologically meaningful structures.

### Quantum Cognition as Theory-Data Integration

An innovative precedent for allowing data to challenge and reshape theoretical frameworks comes from quantum cognition research. Wang et al.explain that this research program is "driven by a myriad of puzzling findings and stubborn challenges in psychological literature, by deep resonations between basic notions of quantum theory and psychological conceptions and intuitions, and by the exhibited potential of the theory to provide coherent and mathematically principled explanations for the puzzles and challenges in human cognitive research." This work illustrates how empirical anomalies—data that resist explanation by classical theoretical frameworks—can motivate the development of entirely new theoretical structures.
  - Citations: Wang et al. (2013)

Aerts et al.further elaborate on this paradigm shift, noting that "starting from the seventies, experimental studies of conceptual categorization, human judgment and perception, and behavioral economics have revealed that this classical conception is fundamentally problematical, in the sense that the cognitive models based on these mathematical structures are" inadequate for capturing human cognition. This represents a clear case where accumulated empirical findings necessitated abandoning theory-driven assumptions in favor of allowing data to suggest alternative structural frameworks.

## Precedents in Human-Computer Interaction


### Adaptive Interaction and Utility Maximization

In HCI, data-driven approaches have been employed to understand how users naturally interact with technology. Payne and Howespresent an Adaptive Interaction framework that "focuses on how we select strategies in our everyday and working lives so as to maximize utility, given varying ecological, social, and cognitive constraints." This approach allows behavioral data to reveal the strategies users actually employ, "whether we are interacting with technology (e.g., a phone, a car, a cockpit, a process control plant, Facebook, or Twitter) or comparing data to make a decision". The framework provides researchers with "a powerful way of understanding and reasoning about why people behave and perform tasks in the ways they do", grounded in observed behavioral patterns rather than predetermined theoretical assumptions.
  - Citations: Payne (2013)


### Multimodal Learning Analytics

The field of multimodal learning analytics exemplifies data-driven structure discovery in educational HCI contexts. Mitri et al.describe how "with the rise of data-driven techniques to discover insights and generate predictions from the learning process such as learning analytics, the need for 360° data about learners has grown consistently." Their work emphasizes that "combining data coming from multiple sources has become a prominent necessity in learning research and has led to an increased interest in multimodality and consequently into multimodal data analysis". This approach allows the integration of diverse data streams to reveal learning patterns that might not be apparent from any single theoretical perspective.
  - Citations: Mitri et al. (2018)


### Sensemaking and Cognitive Process Modeling

Zhang and Soergelpresent a comprehensive model of cognitive sensemaking processes that integrates empirical observations with theoretical frameworks. Their model "illustrates the iterative processes of sensemaking, extends existing models that focus on activities by integrating cognitive mechanisms and the creation of instantiated structure elements of knowledge, and different types of conceptual change to show a complete picture of the cognitive processes of sensemaking". This work demonstrates how data-driven observations of user behavior can inform and extend theoretical models of human-computer interaction.
  - Citations: Zhang (2014)


## Precedents in Communication Research


### Computational Methods in Media Psychology

Fisherprovides a comprehensive overview of how computational approaches have transformed communication research, noting that "as media environments become increasingly complex and data-rich, computational approaches have become more mainstream for studying media selection, processing, and effects." These computational tools "afford media psychology researchers new forms of data, new ways to pre-process data to clarify and add structure to unstructured information, and richer ways to build and test theories". This characterization explicitly acknowledges the role of data-driven methods in revealing structure within complex communication phenomena.
  - Citations: Fisher (2025)


### Empathy Modeling and Behavioral Signal Processing

Xiao et al.provide a systematic review of computational approaches to empathy modeling that illustrates the interplay between theory-driven and data-driven approaches. They "categorize empathy simulation studies into theory-based emotion space modeling or application-driven user and context modeling", explicitly acknowledging both paradigms. Their work summarizes "challenges in the computational study of empathy, including conceptual framing and understanding of empathy, data availability, appropriate use and validation of machine learning techniques, and behavioral signal processing", highlighting the methodological considerations that inform the choice between approaches.
  - Citations: Xiao et al. (2016)


### Information Overload and Emergent Factors

Chen et al.demonstrate data-driven discovery in communication research through their investigation of information overload in online learning. Their study identified "emerging data-driven risk factors" including "lack of efficiency in reading from computer screens, visual and auditory learning preferences, and time constraints". This work exemplifies how allowing data to reveal structure can identify factors that might not have been anticipated from existing theoretical frameworks alone.
  - Citations: Chen et al. (2011)


## When Data-Driven Approaches Are Preferable


### Complexity and High Dimensionality

Data-driven approaches become particularly valuable when dealing with complex, high-dimensional phenomena. Chen and Wojcikemphasize that big data methods, including both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, are especially suited to contexts where the volume and variety of behavioral data exceed what traditional theory-driven approaches can accommodate. The ability to process and find patterns in massive datasets represents a fundamental advantage of data-driven methods.
  - Citations: Chen (2016)


### Novel or Undertheorized Domains

When theoretical frameworks are underdeveloped or when research enters genuinely novel domains, data-driven approaches can serve as essential discovery tools. Doornwaard et al.demonstrate this principle, showing how psychological network analysis can "generate novel hypotheses about causal processes" in domains where existing theories may be incomplete or inadequate. Similarly, the quantum cognition research program emerged precisely because classical theoretical frameworks proved insufficient to explain accumulated empirical findings.
  - Citations: Doornwaard et al. (2025), Wang et al. (2013), Aerts et al. (2016)


### Generating Hypotheses for Future Theory Development

Data-driven approaches are particularly valuable for hypothesis generation. Schneider and Edelsbrunnerdistinguish between "modeling for prediction vs. modeling for understanding," noting that while they advocate for "more theory-driven and parsimonious modeling techniques over ANNs whenever possible," they acknowledge that data-driven methods have important roles in exploratory research. The key insight is that data-driven discovery can inform subsequent theory development, creating a productive cycle between empirical observation and theoretical refinement.
  - Citations: Schneider (2013)


### Complementing Rather Than Replacing Theory

Schlosser et al.provide an instructive example of how theory-driven and data-driven approaches can be productively integrated. Their work on meditation mechanisms demonstrates that "complementing data-driven approaches, this study offers preliminary support for using a theoretical model of meditation-related mechanisms to create empirically meaningful and psychometrically sound composite scores". This suggests that the choice between approaches need not be binary; rather, they can serve complementary functions within a research program.
  - Citations: Schlosser et al. (2022)


## Methodological Considerations and Limitations


### The Need for Validation

While data-driven approaches offer powerful discovery capabilities, they require careful validation. Xiao et al.identify "appropriate use and validation of machine learning techniques" as a key challenge in computational behavioral research. Similarly, Schneider and Edelsbrunnercaution that modern regression techniques, including Bayesian structural equation models, "have advantages similar to those of ANNs but without the drawbacks" and can "handle numerous variables, non-linear effects, multi-way interactions, and incomplete data" while maintaining interpretability.
  - Citations: Xiao et al. (2016), Schneider (2013)


### Interpretability and Theoretical Integration

A persistent challenge for data-driven approaches is ensuring that discovered structures can be meaningfully interpreted and integrated with existing theoretical knowledge. Tojeknotes that quantitative data extracted through computational analysis can be invaluable for populating various behavioral, cognitive, or social models used in advanced social science investigations, but this requires careful attention to how data-driven findings connect to theoretical frameworks.


### Ethical and Practical Considerations

Pasupuletiemphasizes that "visualization and interpretability are positioned as essential components of the analytical process, with emphasis on ethical representation and narrative storytelling." The work addresses "regulatory and ethical considerations, including data privacy, algorithmic fairness, and the societal implications of automated decision-making", highlighting that data-driven approaches carry responsibilities beyond mere technical implementation.

## Conclusion

Substantial precedents exist across psychology, HCI, and communication research for approaches that allow data to reveal structure rather than imposing predetermined theoretical frameworks. These precedents range from psychological network analysisand deep learning-based behavioral clusteringto computational media psychologyand multimodal learning analytics. The quantum cognition research programprovides a particularly compelling example of how empirical anomalies can motivate fundamental theoretical reconceptualization.

Data-driven approaches are preferable to theory-driven feature selection when dealing with high-dimensional complexity, exploring novel or undertheorized domains, generating hypotheses for future theory development, or when existing theoretical frameworks prove inadequate to explain accumulated findings. However, the most productive research programs often integrate both approaches, using data-driven discovery to complement and extend theoretical understandingwhile maintaining attention to interpretability, validation, and ethical considerations.

The field appears to be moving toward a more nuanced understanding of the theory-data relationship, recognizing that both approaches have essential roles in advancing scientific understanding of human behavior in technological and communicative contexts.

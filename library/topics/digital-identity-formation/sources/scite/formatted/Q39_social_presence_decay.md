# Habituation to Social Cues in Human-Computer Interaction: A Systematic Review of Evidence


## Introduction

The question of whether perceived social presence or anthropomorphism of technology declines with extended use represents a critical inquiry at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI), social psychology, and cognitive science. As artificial agents become increasingly prevalent in daily life, understanding the temporal dynamics of users' social responses to these technologies has significant implications for interface design, user experience, and the theoretical foundations of human-technology relationships. This review synthesizes available evidence on habituation to social cues in HCI contexts, examining whether users' perceptions of AI agents as social entities diminish over time.


## Theoretical Foundations of Social Responses to Technology


### The CASA Paradigm and Social Cue Processing

The Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) framework has been widely accepted in HCI research and supported through extensive experimental evidence. This framework posits that people will respond to a computer as a social partner, provided appropriate social cues are produced by the computer. The theoretical underpinning suggests that humans apply social heuristics and interaction schemas developed for human-to-human communication when engaging with technological systems that exhibit social characteristics.

Research on media effects, including social presence theory, has demonstrated that social cues help reduce ambiguity in person impressions during computer-mediated communication. This finding supports assumptions embedded in theories suggesting that the presence or absence of social cues fundamentally shapes how users perceive and interact with mediated communication partners. The social agency theory further posits that social cues in multimedia messages can encourage learners to interpret human-computer interactions as more similar to human-to-human conversation.

### Unconscious Nature of Social Responses

A critical consideration for understanding habituation effects is the observation that people treat technical entities like computers as social actors, with these social reactions appearing to be largely unconscious. Research has documented that users consider their own social responses to devices inappropriate when thought about consciously, yet continue to exhibit these responses nonetheless. This unconscious dimension of social responding to technology suggests that habituation processes may operate differently than conscious attitude change, potentially making social responses more resistant to extinction through mere exposure.

## Evidence for Habituation Mechanisms


### Neurological Foundations of Habituation

Habituation represents a fundamental learning mechanism that has been extensively studied at the neurological level. Classic research established that habituation and sensitization appear to be central neural processes that do not involve presynaptic or postsynaptic inhibition. These processes may result from the interaction of neural mechanisms resembling "polysynaptic low-frequency depression" and "facilitatory afterdischarge," with "membrane desensitization" potentially playing a role in long-lasting habituation. This neurological foundation suggests that habituation to any repeated stimulus, including social cues from technology, follows predictable biological patterns.

The characteristics of habituation identified in foundational research include the gradual decrease in response magnitude with repeated stimulus presentation, spontaneous recovery following rest periods, and the potential for dishabituation when novel stimuli are introduced. These properties have implications for understanding how users might habituate to social cues in HCI contexts over extended use periods.

### Social Cue Processing and Learning

Research on social cue processing reveals important distinctions between social and non-social information channels. Studies examining working memory in virtual reality environments found that social and non-social cues had similar effects on working memory performance, but this was underpinned by differences in neural activations. This finding suggests that while behavioral outcomes may appear similar, the cognitive processing of social versus non-social cues involves distinct neural mechanisms that may respond differently to repeated exposure.
  - Citations: Gregory et al. (2021)

Evidence from infant learning research demonstrates that social cues can shape learning from the first year of life, with these effects remaining robust despite various distractions and changes in experimental conditions. The persistence of social cue effects across varying conditions suggests a fundamental role for social information processing that may be resistant to simple habituation effects.

## Social Presence and Anthropomorphism in Human-Robot Interaction


### Factors Affecting Social Presence Perception

Research examining social cues and signals in human-robot interaction has highlighted the need to examine the relationship between social cues and signals as a function of the degree to which a robot is perceived as a socially present agent. Experimental work manipulating social cues on mobile robotics platforms found that cues associated with the robot's proxemic behavior significantly affected participant perceptions of the robot's social presence and emotional state. This suggests that social presence is not a fixed attribute but rather a dynamic perception influenced by specific behavioral cues.
  - Citations: Fiore et al. (2013)

The investigation of gender stereotyping in robots demonstrates that users readily apply social categories and trait inferences based on physical design features. Research in this area has adapted the classic CASA paradigm to anthropomorphic robots and extended it by researching additional social cues that might be used in inferring traits and functionalities from a robot's physical design. The automatic application of social stereotypes to robotic agents suggests deeply ingrained social processing that may persist despite extended exposure.
  - Citations: Eyssel (2012)


### Complexity of Social Cue Accumulation

Importantly, research on robotic persuasive strategies has revealed that the relationship between social cues and social perception is not simply additive. Studies found that the addition of social cues might lead to the activation of qualitatively different social interaction schemas rather than leading to a quantitative accumulation of separate social cues. This finding extends and nuances social agency theory by suggesting that users may shift between different interpretive frameworks as social cue configurations change. Such qualitative shifts in interpretation could either accelerate or impede habituation processes depending on the specific cues involved.

## Voice and Minimal Social Cues


### Sufficiency of Voice as a Social Cue

Research on animated conversational agents has demonstrated that voice alone may be a sufficient social cue for eliciting social responses. Studies found that if enough social cues are provided by the voice only, the visual agent does not contribute substantially more to comprehension. This finding has important implications for habituation research, as it suggests that even minimal social cues can trigger social processing, potentially making complete habituation difficult to achieve as long as any social cues remain present.
  - Citations: Louwerse et al. (2005)

The retention test results in multimedia learning research, while mixed, are consistent with social agency theory's prediction that social cues encourage learners to interpret human-computer interactions as more similar to human-to-human conversation. The persistence of these effects across different experimental conditions suggests some robustness against habituation, though direct longitudinal evidence remains limited.
  - Citations: Mayer et al. (2003)


## Implications for Extended Use


### Competitive Advantages of Social Cues

Research on retail web environments has found that there is a competitive advantage for online retailers that use social cues that provide consumers with enhanced perceptions of human connection and the formation of emotional bonds. This finding suggests that social cues continue to provide value in commercial contexts, implying that their effects do not completely habituate even with repeated exposure to e-commerce platforms.
  - Citations: Wang et al. (2007)


### Organizational Communication Patterns

Classic research on electronic mail in organizational communication found that decreasing social context cues has substantial deregulating effects on communication. The study demonstrated that much of the information conveyed through electronic mail was information that would not have been conveyed through another medium. This suggests that the presence or absence of social cues fundamentally shapes communication patterns in ways that persist over organizational timescales, though this does not directly address whether individual users habituate to specific social cues.

## Limitations and Gaps in Current Evidence


### Absence of Direct Longitudinal Studies

A significant limitation in the current literature is the relative absence of direct longitudinal studies examining changes in perceived social presence or anthropomorphism over extended use periods. While the theoretical foundations for understanding habituation are well-established, and the mechanisms of social cue processing in HCI have been extensively documented, the specific question of whether users "forget" that an AI is an agent over time lacks direct empirical investigation in the available literature.

### Methodological Considerations

Research on social engagement with robots has noted that while new robotics technologies allow extension of cognitive and interaction capabilities, their evaluation for social interaction remains challenging. The difficulty in measuring social presence and anthropomorphism over time, combined with the unconscious nature of many social responses to technology, presents methodological challenges for habituation research.

## Conclusions

The available evidence presents a complex picture regarding habituation to social cues in human-computer interaction. The CASA framework and related theories suggest that social responses to technology are robust and may be largely unconscious, potentially making them resistant to simple habituation effects. The neurological foundations of habituation are well-understood, but their specific application to social cue processing in HCI contexts requires further investigation.

Evidence suggests that social cues continue to influence user perceptions and behaviors across various contexts, and that even minimal social cues such as voice alone can be sufficient to trigger social processing. However, the specific question of whether perceived social presence or anthropomorphism declines with extended use, and whether users forget that AI is an agent over time, cannot be definitively answered from the available literature. The complexity of social cue accumulation effectsand the qualitative differences in processing social versus non-social informationsuggest that any habituation effects would likely be nuanced rather than uniform.

Future research should prioritize longitudinal designs that track changes in social presence perception over extended use periods, employ both explicit and implicit measures to capture conscious and unconscious components of social responding, and examine individual differences in habituation rates. Such research would significantly advance our understanding of the temporal dynamics of human-AI relationships.

# Linguistic Differences Between One-Shot Versus Returning Users of Conversational AI Systems


## Introduction

The distinction between one-shot (single-interaction) and returning (longitudinal) users of conversational AI systems represents a critical area of inquiry in human-computer interaction research. Understanding how linguistic behaviors evolve across user engagement patterns is essential for designing more effective conversational agents. While direct comparative studies specifically examining one-shot versus returning users remain limited in the available literature, several foundational principles from conversational AI research, human-machine interaction studies, and linguistic adaptation theories provide valuable insights into this phenomenon.


## Theoretical Foundations of User Adaptation in Conversational Systems


### Partner Adaptation and Conversational Design

Research on human-computer dialogue has established that users fundamentally adapt their communicative behaviors based on their conversational partners and accumulated interaction experience. Brennan's foundational work demonstrated that "...people design what they say specifically for their conversational partners, and they adapt to their partners over the course of a conversation". This principle of partner-specific design suggests that returning users, having accumulated knowledge about the AI system's capabilities and limitations, would exhibit different linguistic patterns compared to one-shot users who lack such experiential knowledge.

### Context Awareness and Longitudinal Interaction

The evolution of large language models has increasingly emphasized context awareness as a crucial factor in conversational AI performance. Memory-augmented architectures have demonstrated "the ability to retain information across interactions, improving continuity in dialogue-based applications". This technological capability directly impacts how returning users may develop different interaction patterns, as they can leverage the system's memory of previous exchanges.

## Linguistic Characteristics of User Interactions


### Prompt Structure and Strategic Communication

Research on user interaction with generative AI has revealed that prompts exhibit "a stable structure and strategic design" that varies significantly based on user experience and digital literacy. The study found that prompts "often include polite forms of address, role-based instructions, meta-commentary, and specifications of format or purpose". This finding suggests that one-shot users, particularly those with limited prior AI experience, may produce more elaborate and explanatory prompts, while returning users develop more efficient, abbreviated communication strategies as they learn the system's interpretive capabilities.

### Formality and Conversational Tone

Research on perceived humanness in chatbots has identified specific linguistic characteristics that influence user experience. Svenningsson and Faraon found that effective chatbot interactions involve "avoiding small talk and maintaining a formal tone; identifying itself as a bot and asking how it can help; providing specific information and articulating itself with sophisticated choices of words and well-constructed sentences". These findings suggest that users who return to conversational AI systems may adapt their own linguistic register to match these formal conventions, while one-shot users may initially attempt more casual, human-like conversational approaches before adjusting their expectations.

### Laughter and Social Behavior Patterns

An important dimension of linguistic behavior in human-AI interaction concerns paralinguistic features such as laughter. Research on human-socialbot interactions has examined "how laughter patterns during spoken language interactions with technology". This research highlights that laughter, as "a social behavior that conveys a variety of emotional states and is also intricately intertwined with linguistic communication", may manifest differently between one-shot users and returning users.

## Functional and Task-Oriented Linguistic Differences


### Information-Seeking Dialogue Structures

Understanding how users would interact with audio-only interaction systems in multi-turn information-seeking dialogues is crucial. The knowledge of how to present search results over an audio-only channel and which interactions take place in this new search paradigm is essential for usability. Returning users likely develop more efficient query formulation strategies and better understand turn-taking conventions.

### Chatbot Functional Components and User Adaptation

The technical architecture of conversational AI systems influences how users adapt their linguistic behavior. Chatbot functions "generally include automatic speech recognition (ASR), natural language understanding (NLU), dialogue management (DM), natural language generation (NLG), and speech synthesis (SS)". Understanding these components allows returning users to optimize their input for system processing.
  - Citations: Shi et al. (2021)


## Social and Relational Dimensions


### Emotional Connection and Companion AI

The relational aspects of conversational AI interaction reveal important differences between user types. Research on AI companions indicates that "the appeal of AI companions lies in their constant availability, non-judgmental approach, and ability to provide tailored (albeit artificial) emotional support". This finding implies that returning users may develop more personalized, emotionally-laden linguistic patterns as they anthropomorphize the AI system.
  - Citations: Savic (2024)


## Implications for System Design


### Personalization and User Modeling

The differences between one-shot and returning users have significant implications for conversational AI design. AI chatbots "offer user-friendly engagement for innovative e-learning, care assistance, and multilingual digital content creation, promoting inclusiveness and AI-enhanced communication". The combination of "personalization, interoperability, and scalability" suggests that systems should adapt their responses based on user history, recognizing the different linguistic needs of new versus experienced users.
  - Citations: Karyotaki et al. (2024)


### Dynamic Conversation Management

Effective conversational AI must accommodate both user types through dynamic conversation management. Understanding "the structure of AI-driven user interactions in general" is essential for creating systems that serve both user populations effectively.
  - Citations: McGRATH (2024)


## Conclusion

The linguistic differences between one-shot and returning users of conversational AI systems emerge across multiple dimensions: prompt structure and strategic design, formality and register, paralinguistic features, information-seeking strategies, and emotional engagement. Returning users develop more efficient communication patterns through accumulated experience with system capabilities and limitations, while one-shot users exhibit more exploratory and potentially misaligned linguistic behaviors. These differences have profound implications for conversational AI design, suggesting the need for adaptive systems that can recognize user experience levels and adjust their interaction strategies accordingly. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies that directly compare linguistic evolution across user engagement patterns to further refine our understanding of this phenomenon.

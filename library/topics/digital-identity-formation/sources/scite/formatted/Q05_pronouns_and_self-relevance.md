# Evidence for First-Person Pronoun Usage Reflecting Self-Relevance, Identity Involvement, and Psychological Ownership in Human-Computer Interaction Contexts


## Introduction

The relationship between first-person pronoun usage and psychological constructs such as self-relevance, identity involvement, and psychological ownership has garnered significant scholarly attention across multiple disciplines. Understanding how linguistic markers—particularly personal pronouns—function as indicators of psychological states is particularly relevant in human-computer interaction (HCI) contexts, where the nature of communication between users and systems continues to evolve. This synthesis examines the available evidence linking first-person pronoun usage to these psychological constructs, drawing upon research from psychology, linguistics, marketing, and HCI.


## Theoretical Foundations: First-Person Pronouns and Self-Representation


### The Minimal Self and Pronoun Usage

Research has established a fundamental connection between first-person pronoun usage and the experience of self. The use of the first-person pronoun in a self-referring manner is argued to be related to the minimal self—the "self" experienced as an immediate subject of experience in a moment, as distinguished from the narrative self that extends over time. This theoretical grounding suggests that when individuals employ first-person pronouns, they are linguistically encoding their immediate subjective experience and sense of self-presence.

### Self-Construal and Pronoun Selection

The relationship between pronoun usage and self-construal has been empirically demonstrated across cultural contexts. Research has shown that participants select first-person pronouns with greater frequency in conditions of abundance compared to scarcity, with this pattern being particularly evident for first-person singular pronouns. Theory and research have associated first-person singular pronouns with independent constructions of self and disjoint experience of agency, providing evidence that pronoun selection reflects underlying self-construal patterns. This finding is corroborated by priming studies demonstrating that Dutch participants primed with first-person pronouns (I) compared to third-person pronouns (he) exhibited less automatic mimicry, presumably because I-priming cued difference and separateness rather than closeness with others.

## First-Person Pronouns as Markers of Self-Relevance


### Personal Relevance and Lexical Processing

Evidence from cognitive psychology demonstrates that personal relevance, as indexed by first-person pronoun co-occurrence, influences lexical processing. Research has defined a measure of personal relevance derived from first-order co-occurrence of words with the first-person singular personal pronoun "I". This approach builds on earlier findings showing that personally relevant words were rated as having higher subjective familiarity than words that were not personally relevant, suggesting that personally relevant words are processed more fluently. This fluency effect indicates that first-person pronoun associations serve as reliable markers of self-relevance in cognitive processing.

### Visual Perspective and Pronoun-Induced Self-Relevance

The connection between first-person pronouns and self-relevant processing extends to visual cognition. Research has demonstrated that pronouns interact with picture perspectives, showing faster verification when the implied perspectives of pronouns and pictures matched rather than mismatched. Specifically, the grammatical persons "I am" and "You are" promoted faster response times when verifying internal rather than external perspective pictures, while "He is" promoted faster responses for external perspectives. These findings indicate that readers use pronouns to differentiate perspectives and are more likely to internalize action when sentences use the first-person perspective, demonstrating the self-relevance implications of pronoun usage.

## Identity Involvement and Pronoun Usage


### Authorial Presence and Identity Construction

In academic and professional communication contexts, first-person pronouns serve as primary markers of identity involvement. Research examining authorial presence has demonstrated that first-person pronouns (I, we, my, our, me, us) function as key strategies for achieving interaction between writers and their audience. Self-mentions—phrases containing first-person pronouns and possessive adjectives—are directly oriented to the image of the author and reflect the subjective-modal side of communication.

### Professional Identity and Pronoun Patterns

The relationship between pronoun usage and identity construction has been examined in professional contexts that parallel HCI interactions. Research on computer-mediated discourse in supervision contexts has highlighted how different uses of "we" reflect professional role and identity. Specifically, interns primarily use exclusive "we" to refer to themselves and others as they depict themselves interacting at their sites, while supervisors use professional "we" meaning "you (the intern) and I". This differentiation demonstrates how pronoun selection reflects and constructs professional identity in mediated communication contexts.

### Digital Identity Expression

In digital communication environments, first-person pronouns serve as vehicles for identity expression. Research on WhatsApp status messages has shown that users employ self-mention, realized through first-person singular and possessive pronouns (I, my), as a primary metadiscourse element for portraying identity. This finding demonstrates that in technology-mediated contexts, individuals strategically deploy first-person pronouns to construct and communicate their identities to others.

## Psychological Ownership and Pronoun Usage


### Theoretical Framework of Psychological Ownership

Psychological ownership—the feeling that something is "mine" or "ours"—has been empirically linked to important attitudinal and behavioral outcomes. Research has demonstrated relationships between psychological ownership and commitment, satisfaction, involvement, integration, and self-perceived changes in attitudes and work-related behaviors. The linguistic expression of this psychological state through possessive pronouns represents a key mechanism through which ownership feelings are communicated and potentially reinforced.

### Pronoun Effects on Brand Psychological Ownership

The influence of personal pronouns on psychological ownership has been examined in marketing and consumer contexts that inform HCI applications. Research suggests that the use of pronouns such as "we," "I," and "you," along with their possessive forms "my," "our," and "your," have different persuasive effects on marketing communication outcomes. Pseudo-ownership advertising appeals that employ possessive pronouns can create brand psychological ownership, with effects moderated by self-construal and customer type.

### Empowerment and Ownership Feelings

The psychological consequences of consumer empowerment provide additional evidence for the pronoun-ownership connection. Research has demonstrated that customers who are empowered to select products show stronger demand for those products because they develop a stronger feeling of psychological ownership. This finding suggests that active engagement—which may be linguistically marked through first-person pronoun usage—generates ownership feelings that influence subsequent attitudes and behaviors.

## Evidence from Human-Computer Interaction Contexts


### Customer-Firm Interactions and Pronoun Effects

Direct evidence from HCI-adjacent contexts demonstrates the impact of first-person pronoun usage on user perceptions and behaviors. Research on customer-firm interactions has revealed that firm agents who refer to themselves using "I" rather than "we" pronouns increase customer perceptions that the agent feels and acts on their behalf. These positive perceptions of empathy and agency lead to increased customer satisfaction, purchase intentions, and purchase behavior. This finding has direct implications for the design of conversational agents and chatbots in HCI contexts.

### Brand Relationships and Pronoun Variations

Minor language variations in pronoun usage produce significant effects on consumer attitudes toward brands. Research has demonstrated that the closeness implied by pronouns (e.g., "we" versus "you and I") affects brand perceptions, with effects depending on whether the implied closeness is consistent with people's expected interactions with the brand. These effects are moderated by people's affiliation with the brand, brand type, and the extent of cognitive elaboration, and are mediated by perceived brand trustworthiness. Such findings inform the design of brand communications in digital interfaces.

### Sentence Completion and User Experience Research

Methodological research in user experience (UX) has examined how pronoun variations in research instruments affect outcomes. Studies investigating the sentence completion technique as a UX research method have tested the effect of sentence stem variations, comparing impersonal stems without pronouns to stems formulated using first-person pronouns. This research acknowledges the potential for first-person pronouns to influence how users engage with and respond to UX research instruments, reflecting assumptions about the self-relevance implications of pronoun usage.

### Smartphone Self-Incorporation

Research combining HCI and psychology has explored how smartphones become incorporated into users' sense of self. Studies have investigated the idea that smartphones represent objects to which people feel emotionally attached and which are perceived as part or an extension of a person's self. This research on self-incorporation of technology demonstrates how psychological ownership and identity involvement manifest in human-technology relationships, with implications for understanding pronoun usage in describing these relationships.

### Adaptive HCI and Personal Relevance

The importance of personal relevance in HCI has been recognized in research on adaptive systems. Literature reviews on robot-to-user adaptation have revealed perceived personal relevance as the central determinant of successful adaptation during human-robot interaction. This emphasis on personal relevance—which may be linguistically indexed through first-person pronoun usage—highlights the psychological mechanisms underlying effective human-computer interaction.

## Synthesis and Implications

The evidence reviewed demonstrates multiple pathways through which first-person pronoun usage reflects self-relevance, identity involvement, and psychological ownership. First, pronoun usage is theoretically grounded in the experience of minimal self, with first-person pronouns encoding immediate subjective experience. Second, pronoun selection patterns reflect underlying self-construal, with first-person singular pronouns associated with independent self-constructions. Third, personal relevance can be operationalized through first-person pronoun co-occurrence, with personally relevant content processed more fluently. Fourth, first-person pronouns serve as markers of authorial presence and identity in both academic and digital communication contexts. Fifth, possessive pronouns and first-person references contribute to psychological ownership feelings. Finally, in customer-firm and brand interactions that parallel HCI contexts, pronoun variations produce measurable effects on user perceptions, satisfaction, and behavior.

These findings collectively suggest that first-person pronoun usage in HCI contexts serves as both a reflection of and a mechanism for establishing self-relevance, identity involvement, and psychological ownership. The implications extend to the design of conversational interfaces, chatbots, and adaptive systems, where pronoun choices may significantly influence user experience and engagement.


## Conclusion

The evidence synthesized in this review demonstrates robust connections between first-person pronoun usage and psychological constructs of self-relevance, identity involvement, and psychological ownership. While direct HCI research on this topic remains limited, converging evidence from psychology, linguistics, marketing, and related fields provides a strong theoretical and empirical foundation for understanding these relationships. Future research should more directly examine pronoun usage patterns in diverse HCI contexts, including voice interfaces, chatbots, and adaptive systems, to further elucidate how linguistic markers of self-reference influence user experience and human-computer relationships.

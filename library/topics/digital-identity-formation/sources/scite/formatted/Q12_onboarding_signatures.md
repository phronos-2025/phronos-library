# Research on Onboarding Signatures and Early-Use Patterns as Predictors of Technology Adoption and Sustained Use


## Introduction

The relationship between early user experiences and long-term technology adoption represents a critical area of inquiry in technology adoption research. Early interactions with technology systems establish patterns that can either facilitate or inhibit sustained engagement, creating what researchers describe as virtuous or vicious cycles of technology use. This synthesis examines the existing research landscape on how initial engagement patterns, early experiences, and onboarding characteristics predict both technology adoption and sustained use across diverse technological contexts.

## Early User Experiences and Adoption Trajectories


### The Significance of Initial Interactions

Research demonstrates that early user experiences with technologies significantly impact long-term adoption and sustained use patterns. The distinction between initial adoption and sustained use represents a fundamental consideration in technology adoption research. While many adoption studies have historically focused on the enablers and barriers of initial technology acquisition, the mechanisms underlying sustained use remain less thoroughly examined. This gap is particularly important because initial adoption does not guarantee continued engagement; rather, early experiences establish trajectories that shape future technology utilization.
  - Citations: Chen et al. (2025), Carri (2018)

Chen et al.document a critical pattern wherein initial failures with technology contribute to a diminished willingness to invest time and effort in mastering the system. This creates what they characterize as a "cycle of avoidance," where negative early interactions establish long-lasting reservations about technology engagement. Conversely, positive early interactions can generate a "virtuous cycle of increasing confidence and proactive engagement". These opposing trajectories suggest that onboarding experiences function as critical junctures determining whether users progress toward sustained adoption or retreat from technology use.

### Attitude Formation and Behavioral Intentions

The formation of user attitudes during early technology encounters mediates the relationship between technology characteristics and behavioral intentions toward adoption. Geddamdemonstrates that both perceived usefulness and ease of use during initial interactions foster positive user attitudes, which subsequently enhance behavioral intentions toward technology adoption. This mediation pathway suggests that onboarding experiences that successfully communicate functional benefits and ensure user-friendliness establish the attitudinal foundations necessary for sustained technology use.
  - Citations: Geddam (2024)

The implications of this research underscore the importance of comprehensive training and effective communication strategies during onboarding phases. Organizations seeking to facilitate technology adoption must recognize that early experiences shape not only immediate adoption decisions but also the attitudinal frameworks through which users subsequently evaluate and engage with technologies.

## Technology Acceptance Models and Early Adoption Patterns


### Foundational Acceptance Frameworks

Davisestablished that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and social influence represent primary factors affecting user acceptance of information technology. While Davis's original Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) did not explicitly address onboarding signatures, the framework identifies the perceptual dimensions that early experiences establish. The initial interactions users have with technology systems shape their perceptions of usefulness and ease of use, which subsequently predict acceptance and sustained use.
  - Citations: Davis (1989)

Research extending Davis's framework has identified additional factors influencing early adoption patterns. Social influence, convenience, and hedonic motivations all affect user perception and interact with one another to shape technology acceptance. These factors operate particularly powerfully during onboarding phases when users form initial impressions and establish usage patterns.
  - Citations: Davis (1989)


### Adoption Network Configuration and Early Market Survival

The configuration of adoption networks surrounding technology introduction significantly influences early adoption patterns and market survival. Dell'Era et al.demonstrate that the number and characteristics of external organizations involved in adoption networks differentially impact early market survival depending on technology maturity. For novel technologies, increasing the number of external organizations in the adoption network represents an appropriate tactical decision, whereas for mature technologies, involving organizations with high brand awareness proves more effective.
  - Citations: Dell (2013)

This research suggests that onboarding experiences are not isolated individual phenomena but rather embedded within broader adoption networks that shape early use patterns. The presence of multiple organizations supporting technology introduction, or the involvement of recognized brands, influences how users encounter and engage with technologies during critical early phases.


## Diffusion Patterns and Early Adopter Characteristics


### Identifying Early Adoption Patterns

Research on the diffusion of innovations reveals distinct patterns in how early adopters engage with technologies. Niudocuments that early adopters of research data management services conduct original research to create systems and serve as change agents in diffusing innovations to other libraries. In contrast, late adopters typically learn from early adopters and use their innovations for establishing their own systems. This distinction suggests that early adopters exhibit distinctive engagement patterns during onboarding that position them as innovation leaders.
  - Citations: Niu (2019)

Guaqueta-Garcia et al.employ diffusion of innovation analysis to examine 3D food printing adoption among early adopters, identifying that decisions to adopt hinge on technology compatibility with existing systems and practices. This research indicates that early adopters evaluate technologies during onboarding phases based on integration potential with established workflows, suggesting that compatibility assessments during initial use predict sustained adoption.
  - Citations: Guaqueta-Garcia et al. (2024)


### Geographic and Sectoral Variation in Early Adoption

Early adoption patterns exhibit significant geographic and sectoral variation. McElheran et al.document that early AI adoption was far from evenly distributed, with a handful of "superstar" cities and emerging hubs leading startups' adoption of AI. These patterns of early AI use foreshadow broader economic and social impacts, with the possibility of a growing "AI divide" if early patterns persist. This research suggests that onboarding experiences and early adoption patterns are geographically clustered, with implications for technology diffusion trajectories.
  - Citations: McElheran et al. (2024)

Similarly, research on technology adoption in specific sectors reveals that early adoption patterns vary by industry context. McElheranfinds that market leaders were significantly more likely to adopt incremental innovations like e-buying but less likely to adopt radical innovations like e-selling, highlighting how organizational characteristics shape early adoption patterns.
  - Citations: McElheran (2015)


## Sustained Use and Behavioral Change


### From Adoption to Sustained Engagement

The transition from initial adoption to sustained use requires understanding how early experiences establish behavioral patterns. Pinkse and Bohnsackargue that understanding sustainable product innovation requires examining not only why consumers adopt products but also what makes them use these products in intended ways. They introduce affordance theory, which explains how specific product features can change the ways users engage with technologies during adoption and usage phases. Affordances—the potential for agentic action of users in relation to technological objects—shape how users interact with technologies beyond initial adoption.
  - Citations: Pinkse (2021)

This framework suggests that onboarding experiences that effectively communicate product affordances and enable users to discover action possibilities establish foundations for sustained, appropriate technology use. Users who understand what technologies afford them during onboarding phases are more likely to develop sustained engagement patterns aligned with technology design intentions.


### Behavioral Adaptation and Feedback Cycles

Bennett et al.document that technology adopters in educational contexts make adaptations in response to positive feedback and undesirable outcomes. This research reveals that early use experiences generate feedback that shapes subsequent technology engagement, creating iterative cycles of adaptation and refinement. Onboarding experiences that facilitate rapid feedback loops enable users to adjust their engagement patterns and discover effective use strategies.
  - Citations: Bennett et al. (2016)


## Organizational and Contextual Factors in Early Adoption


### Organizational Readiness and Adoption Decisions

Chwelos et al.identify three factors as determinants of technology adoption: readiness, perceived benefits, and external pressure. By testing these factors together in a single model, they demonstrate their relative contributions to adoption decisions. Organizational readiness during onboarding phases—encompassing technical infrastructure, workforce capabilities, and strategic alignment—predicts whether organizations progress from initial adoption to sustained implementation.
  - Citations: Chwelos et al. (2001)


### Infrastructure and Implementation Characteristics

Whitaker et al.find that RFID implementation spending and partner mandates are associated with expectations of early return on investment, while perceived lack of industry-wide standards is associated with expectations of delayed returns. This research suggests that onboarding experiences shaped by adequate implementation investment and clear standards facilitate positive early assessments that predict sustained adoption.
  - Citations: Whitaker et al. (2007)

Similarly, research on technology diffusion in specific sectors reveals that infrastructure development influences early adoption patterns. Hou and Jiadocument that government investment in communication infrastructure and operator expansion of service types significantly affect early-stage technology adoption rates. These contextual factors shape the onboarding environment within which users encounter technologies.
  - Citations: Hou (2023)


## Barriers and Challenges in Early Adoption


### Avoidance Cycles and Negative Early Experiences

Chen et al.emphasize that initial failures contribute to diminished willingness to invest time and effort in technology mastery, establishing avoidance cycles with long-lasting consequences. This pattern highlights the critical importance of designing onboarding experiences that minimize early failures and establish positive initial interactions. Technologies that generate negative early experiences face substantial barriers to sustained adoption, regardless of their functional capabilities.
  - Citations: Chen et al. (2025)


### Adoption Study Limitations and Research Gaps

Lewis and Pattanayaknote that adoption studies of improved cookstoves and clean energy technologies are scarce, scattered, and of differential quality, despite rapid expansion of global distribution programs. They identify potentially important drivers such as credit, supply-chain strengthening, and social marketing that have been largely ignored in adoption research. This gap suggests that comprehensive understanding of onboarding signatures requires examining not only individual user experiences but also the broader contextual and support systems that shape early technology encounters.
  - Citations: Lewis (2012)


## Synthesis: Onboarding Signatures as Predictive Indicators


### Defining Onboarding Signatures

The research literature, while not explicitly using the term "onboarding signatures," provides substantial evidence that early-use patterns function as predictive indicators of technology adoption and sustained use. Onboarding signatures can be understood as the distinctive patterns of initial technology engagement that emerge when users first encounter systems. These signatures encompass perceptual formations, behavioral adaptations, feedback cycles, and attitudinal developments that occur during critical early phases.


### Predictive Mechanisms

Multiple mechanisms through which onboarding signatures predict sustained adoption emerge from the research synthesis:

Attitudinal Pathways: Early experiences shape perceived usefulness and ease of use, which mediate the relationship between technology characteristics and behavioral intentions,. Users who form positive attitudes during onboarding demonstrate higher propensity for sustained engagement.
  - Citations: Davis (1989), Geddam (2024)

Virtuous and Vicious Cycles: Initial interactions establish trajectories toward either increasing confidence and proactive engagement or diminished willingness and avoidance. These opposing cycles, once established during onboarding, demonstrate substantial persistence.
  - Citations: Chen et al. (2025)

Affordance Discovery: Early experiences that enable users to discover technology affordances establish foundations for sustained, appropriate use. Users who understand action possibilities during onboarding develop more sophisticated engagement patterns.
  - Citations: Pinkse (2021)

Feedback Integration: Onboarding experiences that facilitate rapid feedback loops enable users to adapt engagement strategies and refine technology use. This iterative process during early phases predicts sustained engagement.
  - Citations: Bennett et al. (2016)

Network Positioning: Early adoption patterns reflect positioning within adoption networks,. Users who encounter technologies within supportive adoption networks during onboarding demonstrate different adoption trajectories than isolated users.
  - Citations: Dell (2013), Niu (2019)


### Contextual Variation

The predictive power of onboarding signatures varies substantially across contexts. Organizational readiness, infrastructure development, implementation investment, and sectoral characteristicsall shape how early experiences translate into sustained adoption. Onboarding signatures must be interpreted within their specific organizational and technological contexts to predict adoption outcomes accurately.
  - Citations: Chwelos et al. (2001), Hou (2023), Whitaker et al. (2007), McElheran (2015)


## Implications for Technology Implementation


### Design and Delivery of Onboarding Experiences

The research synthesis suggests that organizations seeking to facilitate sustained technology adoption should prioritize onboarding experience design. Comprehensive training and effective communication strategies during onboarding phases establish the attitudinal and behavioral foundations necessary for sustained use. Onboarding should explicitly address perceived usefulness and ease of use, as these perceptions formed during initial encounters predict subsequent adoption.
  - Citations: Geddam (2024), Davis (1989)


### Monitoring Early-Use Patterns

Organizations implementing new technologies should monitor early-use patterns as predictive indicators of adoption trajectories. Patterns indicating positive attitudes, successful affordance discovery, and effective feedback integration during onboarding suggest a higher probability of sustained adoption. Conversely, patterns indicating avoidance, negative attitudes, or failed affordance discovery warrant intervention to prevent establishment of vicious cycles.
  - Citations: Chen et al. (2025)


### Support System Development

The research emphasizes that onboarding experiences are embedded within broader support systems. Organizations should develop comprehensive support structures—including training programs, communication channels, implementation investment, and adoption network involvement—that shape the onboarding environment,,. These contextual factors significantly influence whether early experiences establish foundations for sustained adoption.
  - Citations: Dell (2013), Hou (2023), Whitaker et al. (2007)


## Conclusion

While the research literature does not explicitly address "onboarding signatures" as a defined construct, substantial evidence demonstrates that early-use patterns function as significant predictors of technology adoption and sustained use. Early user experiences establish attitudinal frameworks, behavioral patterns, and engagement trajectories that demonstrate substantial persistence. Positive early interactions generate virtuous cycles of increasing confidence and engagement, while negative experiences establish vicious cycles of avoidance and diminished investment.
  - Citations: Chen et al. (2025)

The mechanisms through which early experiences predict sustained adoption operate through multiple pathways: attitude formation affecting behavioral intentions, affordance discovery enabling appropriate use, feedback integration facilitating behavioral adaptation, and network positioning shaping adoption trajectories,. These mechanisms operate within specific organizational and technological contexts that substantially influence their predictive power,,,.
  - Citations: Geddam (2024), Pinkse (2021), Bennett et al. (2016), Dell (2013), Niu (2019), Chwelos et al. (2001), McElheran (2015), Hou (2023), Whitaker et al. (2007)

Future research should explicitly examine onboarding signatures as predictive constructs, developing frameworks that integrate individual user experiences with organizational and contextual factors. Such research would advance understanding of how technology implementation organizations can design onboarding experiences that establish foundations for sustained adoption and realize the intended benefits of technology investments.

# Handling the "Feedback Without Advice" Challenge in Psychometric and Personality Assessment Contexts


## Introduction

The provision of assessment feedback without accompanying prescriptive advice represents a significant methodological and ethical challenge in psychometric and personality assessment contexts. This challenge emerges from the tension between providing individuals with meaningful information about their psychological characteristics while avoiding directive guidance that may be inappropriate, premature, or outside the assessor's professional scope. The literature reveals that this challenge manifests across multiple domains, including leadership development, clinical assessment, and organizational contexts, with various approaches emerging to address it.


## The Nature of the Challenge in Assessment Contexts


### Psychometric Assessment in Leadership and Organizational Development

Leadership development programs have extensively grappled with the feedback-without-advice challenge, particularly when utilizing psychometric instruments. What is commonly termed "leadership development" programs are frequently "leader development" programs that typically involve a mix of competency models, psychometric assessment of personality, emotional intelligence, team management profiles, 360-degree feedback, communication skills training, coaching, mentoring, motivational speeches, and outdoor development. This comprehensive approach suggests that psychometric feedback is rarely delivered in isolation but is embedded within broader developmental frameworks.

The integration of multiple assessment modalities represents one strategy for addressing the feedback challenge. Programs have been developed that include "creating programme-selection criteria (making sure to include personality traits such as desire, purposefulness, and confidence), defining leadership competencies, establishing an application process, assessing participants' current leadership skills (using 360-degree feedback, assessment centres, and appraisal data)". This multi-method approach allows feedback to be contextualized within observable competencies rather than delivered as abstract personality descriptions.

Similarly, research on public sector leadership development demonstrates that programs emphasize "emotional intelligence" alongside "self-awareness and contrasting leadership styles," making extensive use of "e-learning, coaching and mentoring, secondments, and attachments". The pairing of psychometric feedback with coaching and mentoring relationships provides a mechanism for individuals to process assessment information with professional support without the assessor necessarily providing direct advice.

### The Role of Coaching and Mentoring as Feedback Mechanisms

The literature suggests that coaching relationships serve as a critical bridge between raw assessment feedback and actionable understanding. Research on artificial intelligence in coaching contexts notes that "AI coaching comes with another opportunity over traditional coaching in this step: the standardized inclusion of diagnostic tools, such as personality inventories or burnout and stress psychometrics". Notably, the same research observes that "although human coaches can easily employ diagnostics as well, they typically do not," suggesting a gap between assessment capability and implementation in feedback contexts.

The matching of mentors and protégés has been identified as crucial for effective feedback delivery. Research indicates that two primary factors must be considered: "(1) the matching process (i.e., how matches are made and facilitated by practitioners such as incorporating participant input on matches); and (2) individual characteristics (i.e., individual differences that may serve as matching criteria such as experiential, surface-level, and deep-level characteristics)". This framework suggests that effective feedback delivery requires careful attention to the relational context in which assessment information is shared.

## Methodological Approaches to Feedback Delivery


### Structured Feedback Instruments and Scorecards

One approach to managing the feedback-without-advice challenge involves the development of structured feedback instruments that provide standardized information without prescriptive recommendations. Research on regulatory assessment contexts demonstrates this approach through "two scorecards developed through a process of conceptualization, item generation, and reduction, as well as psychometric testing, for regulatory authorities to provide feedback to companies on the quality of their submissions while companies report to authorities on the quality of their review". These scorecards "included more than 50 items grouped into 7 domains," providing comprehensive feedback within a structured framework that allows recipients to draw their own conclusions.

### Cognitive Debriefing and Iterative Feedback Processes

The development of assessment instruments themselves often incorporates feedback mechanisms that model appropriate feedback delivery. Research on scale development describes processes where "Wave 2 and 3 interviews (n = 15, both) involved completion and cognitive debriefing of items generated based on Wave 1 interviews. Therapeutic area experts were consulted throughout all key steps of the study. In particular, feedback was provided for item refinement and response option decisions". This iterative approach demonstrates how feedback can be structured to inform without directing, allowing participants to contribute to meaning-making processes.

### Near-Peer Coaching Models

An innovative approach to the feedback challenge involves the use of near-peer coaches who can provide observational feedback without the hierarchical implications of supervisor advice. One implementation describes how "to preserve resident autonomy, we identified PGY-3 or PGY-4 residents interested in medical education to serve as 'near-peer' coaches rather than attending physicians". In this model, "coaches observed morning rounds without the attending physician present and used the checklist to assess specific leadership behaviours". The feedback process was structured such that "prior to rounds, the PGY-2 resident identified one or two leadership domains on which they hoped to focus. Following rounds, the coach and observed resident debriefed for 15 minutes on specific ways to improve, focusing on the observed resident's preferred areas". This approach demonstrates how feedback can be recipient-directed rather than assessor-prescribed.

## Quality Considerations in Feedback Delivery


### The Role of Test Selection in Feedback Quality

The quality of feedback is fundamentally constrained by the quality of the assessment instruments employed. Research has highlighted that "the accuracy of psychological assessment may be determined largely by the quality of the test(s) selected; however, in clinical practice, tests may be selected impressionistically, and without sufficient consideration of test validity". This finding suggests that the feedback-without-advice challenge is compounded when assessment selection is driven by factors other than psychometric quality.

Furthermore, research indicates that "surveys of test usage have not necessarily shown robust associations between frequency of test use and psychometric quality", and that "brand recognition (BR; presence/absence of the name of a well-known test) may sometimes diminish attention to psychometric qualities". This suggests that practitioners may need to exercise particular caution in ensuring that feedback is based on psychometrically sound instruments, regardless of their familiarity or market presence.


### Validation and Reliability as Foundations for Feedback

The literature emphasizes that valid and reliable instruments form the necessary foundation for meaningful feedback. Research on patient-reported outcome measures demonstrates that instruments must show strong psychometric properties before being used for feedback purposes. For example, validation studies have established that assessment tools must demonstrate appropriate "reliability and validity" before being "administered over the internet to assess mental health problems".
  - Citations: Piqueras et al. (2021)

Similarly, research on visual function assessment demonstrates that questionnaires must be shown to be "valid and reliable for evaluating the multifaceted effect" of conditions on patients' lives before being "used easily in routine clinical practice". This emphasis on psychometric rigor suggests that the feedback-without-advice challenge is best addressed when the feedback itself is grounded in demonstrably valid assessment data.
  - Citations: Sakane et al. (2013)


## Contextual Factors in Feedback Delivery


### Technology-Mediated Feedback

The emergence of technology-mediated assessment has introduced new considerations for feedback delivery. Research on ecological momentary cognitive testing describes platforms designed "for the self-administration of cognitive tests in ecologically valid ways," suggesting that feedback may increasingly be delivered in naturalistic settings rather than clinical contexts. This shift raises questions about how feedback without advice can be appropriately structured when professional support may not be immediately available.
  - Citations: Moore et al. (2022)

Research on virtual assessment has documented that "feedback obtained revolved around technology (e.g., screen size), lighting, and fatigue of participants," indicating that the medium of assessment and feedback delivery introduces its own challenges that must be addressed independently of content considerations.
  - Citations: Barnes et al. (2024)


### Visual and Real-Time Feedback Systems

Some assessment contexts have developed visual feedback systems that provide information without explicit advice. Research on rehabilitation exercise describes how "the measured pose is overlaid with the instructed motion on a visual display shown to the user during exercise performance". Studies evaluated "quality of motion, comparing user performance with and without visual feedback and with or without exercise guidance," suggesting that visual feedback can serve as an intermediate approach between no feedback and explicit advice.

## Implications for Practice

The literature suggests several key principles for handling the feedback-without-advice challenge in psychometric and personality assessment contexts:

Embedding feedback within developmental relationships: Rather than delivering assessment results in isolation, effective practice involves situating feedback within coaching, mentoring, or developmental relationships where recipients can process information with appropriate support,,.
  - Citations: Preece (2009), Iles (2006)

Utilizing structured feedback instruments: The development of standardized scorecards and feedback frameworks allows for comprehensive information sharing while maintaining appropriate boundaries around advice-giving.
  - Citations: Salek et al. (2012)

Ensuring psychometric quality: The validity and reliability of assessment instruments must be established before feedback is provided, as the quality of feedback is constrained by the quality of the underlying assessment,,.
  - Citations: Piqueras et al. (2021), Sakane et al. (2013)

Incorporating recipient direction: Allowing feedback recipients to identify areas of focus prior to assessment and debriefing preserves autonomy and ensures that feedback addresses recipient-identified needs.
  - Citations: Infosino (2020)

Attending to contextual factors: The medium and setting of feedback delivery, including technology considerations and the availability of professional support, must be considered in designing feedback processes,.
  - Citations: Barnes et al. (2024), Moore et al. (2022)


## Conclusion

The psychometric and personality assessment literature reveals that the feedback-without-advice challenge has been addressed through multiple complementary strategies. These include embedding assessment feedback within broader developmental frameworks, utilizing structured feedback instruments, ensuring rigorous psychometric foundations, incorporating recipient-directed processes, and attending to contextual factors in feedback delivery. The integration of coaching and mentoring relationships with psychometric assessment appears particularly important, as these relationships provide a context for processing assessment information without requiring assessors to provide prescriptive advice. Future developments in technology-mediated assessment will likely require continued attention to how feedback can be appropriately structured in contexts where professional support may be less immediately available.

# Literature Review Outline: MTH-003 Engagement Prediction

## Overview

This outline structures the literature review supporting the methodology document "Predicting User Engagement from First-Prompt Features" (MTH-003). Questions are organized into eight thematic clusters, each addressing a distinct theoretical or methodological foundation.

---

## Cluster I: IT Identity Theory & Human-Technology Integration

Core theoretical foundation for the feature selection rationale.

### Q01: IT Identity Empirical Evidence
What empirical evidence supports the three-dimensional model of IT Identity (relatedness, emotional energy, dependence) proposed by Carter and colleagues?

### Q02: IT Identity Operationalization
How has IT Identity been operationalized and measured in prior research, and what linguistic or behavioral markers have been validated as indicators?

### Q03: IT Identity Development
What longitudinal research exists on the development of IT Identity over time—does early interaction style predict later integration?

### Q04: Alternative Frameworks
Beyond Carter et al., what alternative theoretical frameworks (e.g., Uses and Gratifications, Technology Acceptance Model, self-expansion theory) explain sustained technology engagement?

---

## Cluster II: Linguistic Markers as Psychological Indicators

Validating the feature selection rationale.

### Q05: Pronouns and Self-Relevance
What is the evidence that first-person pronoun usage reflects self-relevance, identity involvement, or psychological ownership in human-computer interaction contexts?

### Q06: Pronouns and Relationship Formation
Does pronoun use in written communication predict relationship formation or sustained engagement in other dyadic contexts (therapeutic alliance, customer service, online communities)?

### Q07: Politeness and Social Orientation
What research connects politeness markers and greeting behavior to social orientation, relational goals, or long-term engagement in digital contexts?

### Q08: Imperatives vs Interrogatives
How do imperative constructions versus interrogative constructions in initial requests predict interaction outcomes, satisfaction, or return behavior?

### Q09: Linguistic Accommodation
What evidence exists for linguistic accommodation or entrainment in human-AI conversation, and does early accommodation predict continued use?

---

## Cluster III: First Impressions & Early Behavior as Predictors

Generalizability of the "first prompt predicts return" hypothesis.

### Q10: First-Session Retention Predictors
In SaaS, app, or platform research, what first-session behavioral features predict long-term retention or churn?

### Q11: Initial Message Features
Does initial message length, complexity, or specificity predict engagement in other asynchronous communication contexts (email, online forums, customer support)?

### Q12: Onboarding Signatures
What research exists on "onboarding signatures" or early-use patterns as predictors of technology adoption and sustained use?

### Q13: Expectation Confirmation
How do expectation-confirmation dynamics in first interactions shape continued engagement with conversational agents or chatbots?

---

## Cluster IV: Intent Diversity & Task Breadth

Supporting the descriptive characterization approach.

### Q14: Task Variety and Engagement
What relationship exists between task variety and sustained engagement in productivity tools, creative software, or multi-purpose platforms?

### Q15: Exploration Breadth
How has "exploration breadth" or "feature adoption breadth" been studied as a correlate or predictor of platform stickiness?

### Q16: Intent Entropy in Human-AI
Does intent entropy or task diversity in human-AI interaction predict satisfaction, perceived utility, or continued use?

---

## Cluster V: Methodological Precedents

Establishing that safeguards are empirically grounded.

### Q17: Temporal Holdout Design
What are best practices for temporal holdout design in observational prediction studies, particularly with evolving systems?

### Q18: New-User Restriction
How have other researchers addressed the new-user restriction problem in engagement prediction to avoid information leakage?

### Q19: Permutation Importance
What is the evidence for permutation importance over coefficient-based importance in applied predictive modeling?

### Q20: Calibration Measurement
How have prior studies operationalized and measured prediction calibration in user behavior models?

### Q21: Signal vs Noise Methods
What methods exist for distinguishing predictive signal from noise in high-dimensional behavioral feature spaces (random feature comparison, regularization)?

---

## Cluster VI: Ecological Validity & Generalization Concerns

Addressing stated limitations proactively.

### Q22: Anonymous vs Authenticated Platforms
How do anonymous/low-friction interfaces differ from authenticated platforms in terms of user engagement patterns and predictive modeling validity?

### Q23: Ecological Fallacy
What research addresses the ecological fallacy in behavioral prediction—when do group-level predictors fail at the individual level?

### Q24: Censoring and Observation Windows
How do censoring and observation window effects bias engagement metrics, and what correction methods are used?

### Q25: Temporal Confound Sensitivity
What sensitivity analyses or robustness checks are standard for engagement prediction models with temporal confounds?

---

## Cluster VII: Conversational AI-Specific Literature

Emerging domain—expected to be sparse.

### Q26: Conversational AI Retention Models
What predictive models of user retention or engagement have been developed specifically for conversational AI or chatbot platforms?

### Q27: Mental Models and Satisfaction
How do users' mental models of AI capabilities (revealed through first prompts) predict satisfaction and continued use?

### Q28: One-Shot vs Returning Users
What linguistic differences exist between one-shot versus returning users of conversational AI systems?

### Q29: Anthropomorphism and Relationship Development
How does perceived anthropomorphism or social presence in first interactions predict relationship development with conversational agents?

---

## Cluster VIII: The Mirror vs Oracle Distinction

Philosophical grounding for the Phronos framing.

### Q30: Behavioral Prediction Ethics
What ethical frameworks or guidelines exist for presenting behavioral predictions to individuals without implying causation or prescription?

### Q31: Feedback Without Advice
How have psychometric and personality assessment contexts handled the "feedback without advice" challenge?

### Q32: Probabilistic Self-Information
What research exists on how people interpret and act on probabilistic self-relevant information?

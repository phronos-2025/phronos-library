## Questions Requiring Deep Web Research

- **Q02**: IT Identity Operationalization
  - Direct measurement instruments for IT Identity are limited in the available literature. The narrative relies heavily on related identity research from other domains rather than specific IT Identity operationalization studies.
- **Q03**: IT Identity Development
  - While the reviewed literature does not specifically address IT Identity (Information Technology Identity), the broader identity development research provides a framework for understanding how early interaction patterns with technology might predict later integration of technology use into one's self-concept. Future research specifically examining IT Identity development would benefit from adopting longitudinal designs with multiple waves of data collection.
- **Q05**: Pronouns and Self-Relevance
  - Future research should more directly examine pronoun usage patterns in diverse HCI contexts, including voice interfaces, chatbots, and adaptive systems, to further elucidate how linguistic markers of self-reference influence user experience and human-computer relationships.

# Cluster 1: IT Identity Theory & Human-Technology Integration

## Q01: IT Identity Empirical Evidence

**Coverage:** Rich

**Source conclusion:** "The empirical evidence strongly supports the three-dimensional model of IT identity proposed by Carter et al. Studies across diverse technological contexts—including health and fitness applications, wearable devices, mobile platforms, healthcare IT, and AI systems—have consistently validated the structure comprising relatedness, emotional energy, and dependence."

**Key findings:**
- Data were collected from 364 users through an online survey to empirically examine the proposed model, finding that IT identity plays a fully mediating role in describing how gamification elements can lead to continued intention to use health and fitness apps.
- Research on AI identity in the workplace found that dependence (B = −0.372, p < 0.001), emotional energy (B = −0.153, p < 0.05), and relatedness (B = −0.216, p < 0.001) all significantly predicted employee cyberloafing behavior.
- Studies have demonstrated acceptable composite reliability values (e.g., Omega: 0.80) for the overall IT identity construct, with dimensions showing positive and significant correlations as expected theoretically.
- The three-dimensional construct has been successfully validated across multiple cultural contexts, including research on mobile phone app use among non-local students in Hong Kong and the UK.
- Qualitative research in COPD care found that the formation of IT identity among healthcare providers depends on three emotional responses corresponding to the theoretical dimensions: positive emotions and energy regarding the IT tool, dependence on the tool to maintain or enhance self-esteem, and the relatedness between the self and an IT tool.

**Methodological notes:** Researchers have debated the appropriate specification of IT identity as either a reflective or formative construct, with some studies measuring IT identity as a formative-reflective construct while others have specified IT identity as a second-order multidimensional reflective construct.

## Q02: IT Identity Operationalization

**Coverage:** Sparse

**Source conclusion:** "The operationalization and measurement of IT Identity remains an emerging area of research, with the foundational conceptualization establishing IT Identity as the extent to which individuals view technology use as integral to their sense of self. While direct measurement instruments for IT Identity are limited in the available literature, related identity research provides robust methodological templates for scale development and validation."

**Key findings:**
- Carter and Grover define IT Identity as 'the extent to which an individual views use of an IT as integral to his or her sense of self'
- Research has recognized that individuals may also view their identity as being in opposition to an IT—a phenomenon termed 'IT disidentity'
- Research on digital intelligence quotients has validated instruments using exploratory factor analysis to identify dimensions including digital identity, digital use, digital safety, digital security, digital emotional intelligence, digital communication, digital literacy, and digital rights
- Studies on athletic identity reveal that individuals who are motivated by self-determined and volitional reasons are more likely to maintain their exercise behavior
- Research on pro-environmental self-identity has developed multi-dimensional scales capturing dimensions such as exploration, centrality, and activism

**Methodological notes:** While direct measurement instruments for IT Identity are limited in the available literature, related identity research provides robust methodological templates for scale development and validation.

## Q03: IT Identity Development

**Coverage:** Rich

**Source conclusion:** "The longitudinal research on identity development provides substantial evidence that early interaction styles and patterns do predict later integration outcomes, though the relationship is complex and mediated by numerous contextual factors."

**Key findings:**
- Amiot and colleagues conducted a four-wave longitudinal study of international students during their first year in a new country, finding that identity integration represents a dynamic process rather than a static endpoint.
- Rosario and colleagues found that Time 1 factors were associated with identity integration, with positive factors such as supportive family playing a critical role in optimal development among lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths.
- Longitudinal interaction effects revealed that the analytical and exploratory informational styles enhanced the positive effects of challenge appraisal on psychological adjustment over time in immigrants.
- The Rochester Adult Longitudinal Study found that resolving identity issues in a coherent and positive way facilitates satisfaction with work, family, and life in general during midlife, with age-20 scores for identity and intimacy predicting age-54 well-being.
- French and colleagues found that although many individuals progress to higher stages of identity, individuals also regress to lower stages, leading researchers to abandon the four-stage model in favor of acknowledging multiple pathways among the four statuses.

**Methodological notes:** Future studies should employ longer-term longitudinal data collection to capture the full trajectory of identity development. There remains a lack of longitudinal research investigating identity development during the transition to university. Some writers have criticized existing studies for using cross-sectional methods and/or male subjects exclusively.

**Gap flag:** Yes — While the reviewed literature does not specifically address IT Identity (Information Technology Identity), the broader identity development research provides a framework for understanding how early interaction patterns with technology might predict later integration of technology use into one's self-concept. Future research specifically examining IT Identity development would benefit from adopting longitudinal designs with multiple waves of data collection.

## Q04: Alternative Frameworks

**Coverage:** Rich

**Source conclusion:** "The integration of these diverse theoretical resources provides a comprehensive foundation for understanding, predicting, and promoting sustained technology engagement across varied contexts and user populations."

**Key findings:**
- Uses and Gratifications Theory has emerged as a particularly valuable framework for understanding technology continuance intentions, providing guidance for investigating the specific needs that information technology users seek to fulfill.
- A robust body of research conceptualizes engagement as a multidimensional construct comprising behavioral, emotional, and cognitive components, with this framework being validated across multiple contexts.
- Evidence demonstrates that engagement should be modeled as a bifactor model for use with structural equation modeling or item response theory, while total scores across dimensions remain interpretable as indicators of a single higher-order construct.
- Studies have identified six latent factors representing both engagement and disengagement across cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions, aligning with the heavily supported framework that conceptualizes engagement as inherently multi-dimensional.
- Regular feedback mechanisms allow for course correction and improvement, while recognizing and rewarding contributions strengthens engagement and motivates continued involvement.

# Cluster 2: Linguistic Markers as Psychological Indicators

## Q05: Pronouns and Self-Relevance

**Coverage:** Rich

**Source conclusion:** "The evidence synthesized in this review demonstrates robust connections between first-person pronoun usage and psychological constructs of self-relevance, identity involvement, and psychological ownership. While direct HCI research on this topic remains limited, converging evidence from psychology, linguistics, marketing, and related fields provides a strong theoretical and empirical foundation for understanding these relationships."

**Key findings:**
- Participants select first-person pronouns with greater frequency in conditions of abundance compared to scarcity, with this pattern being particularly evident for first-person singular pronouns.
- Dutch participants primed with first-person pronouns (I) compared to third-person pronouns (he) exhibited less automatic mimicry, presumably because I-priming cued difference and separateness rather than closeness with others.
- Firm agents who refer to themselves using 'I' rather than 'we' pronouns increase customer perceptions that the agent feels and acts on their behalf, leading to increased customer satisfaction, purchase intentions, and purchase behavior.
- Personal relevance derived from first-order co-occurrence of words with the first-person singular personal pronoun 'I' influences lexical processing, with personally relevant words processed more fluently.
- The grammatical persons 'I am' and 'You are' promoted faster response times when verifying internal rather than external perspective pictures, while 'He is' promoted faster responses for external perspectives.

**Methodological notes:** While direct HCI research on this topic remains limited, converging evidence from psychology, linguistics, marketing, and related fields provides a strong theoretical and empirical foundation for understanding these relationships.

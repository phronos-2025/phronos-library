# LIB-001: Linguistic Markers of Identity

## Question

What features of language reliably encode identity, and which are measurable at scale in chat data?

## Scope

**In:**
- Pronoun patterns (I/we usage, self-reference) and psychological states
- Semantic network structure and individual variation
- Linguistic accommodation in conversation
- Text as proxy for cognition

**Out:**
- Platform effects on identity → LIB-003
- Validity of digital traces → LIB-002
- AI sycophancy → LIB-003, LIB-006

## Key Sources

- De Deyne 2019 — Small World of Words (semantic associations)
- Pennebaker 2015 — LIWC (pronoun-psychology link)
- Beaty & Kenett 2023 — Associative creativity theory
- Ireland 2010 — Language style matching

## Confidence

**Moderate.** Strong theoretical basis from LIWC tradition and semantic network research. Measurement validation for chat contexts incomplete. Human-AI accommodation essentially unstudied.

## Notes

This article treats language as *expressing* pre-existing states (signal model). The constitutive claim—that interaction shapes identity—belongs in LIB-003.

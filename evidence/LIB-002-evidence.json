    "abstract": "As Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our lives, their inherent social biases remain a pressing concern. Detecting and evaluating these biases can be challenging because they are often implicit rather than explicit in nature, so developing evaluation methods that assess the implicit knowledge representations of LLMs is essential. We present a novel word association network methodology for evaluating implicit biases in LLMs based on simulating semantic priming within LLM-generated word association networks. Our prompt-based approach taps into the implicit relational structures encoded in LLMs, providing both quantitative and qualitative assessments of bias. Unlike most prompt-based evaluation methods, our method enables direct comparisons between various LLMs and humans, providing a valuable point of reference and offering new insights into the alignment of LLMs with human cognition. To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we apply it to both humans and several widely used LLMs to investigate social biases related to gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and political party. Our results reveal both convergences and divergences between LLM and human biases, providing new perspectives on the potential risks of using LLMs. Our methodology contributes to a systematic, scalable, and generalizable framework for evaluating and comparing biases across multiple LLMs and humans, advancing the goal of transparent and socially responsible language technologies.",

Recent studies have shown that as humans interact with biased LLMs, we subconsciously absorb the biases in their outputs, even long after we stop interacting with the models22. These findings suggest the emergence of a feedback loop, in which LLMs acquire biases from humans, and through repeated exposure, we absorb new biases from LLMs.”",

        "text": "“Methods for evaluating bias in LLMs can also differ by whether they operate at the model level, directly probing internal representations, or at the output level, treating the model as a black box and using outputs from prompting for investigating bias. Model-level methods are typically intrinsic since they directly access a model’s representational structures, while output-level approaches are typically extrinsic, focusing on specific downstream tasks or specific types of bias in certain domains (e.g. gender bias in recruiting)39. Model-level methods usually fall into one of two categories: embedding-based or probability-based25. Embedding-based metrics such as the well-known Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT)27 and similar variations28,40 apply the logic of the Implicit Association Test (IAT)41, a well-known metric for assessing implicit bias in humans. They measure vector similarities between social categories (e.g. gender) and attributes (e.g. careers) in different types of word embeddings. In contrast, probability-based metrics30 use model-assigned probabilities to estimate biases. For example, masked token metrics ask a masked language model to complete fill-in-the-blank sentences30,42, and pseudo-log-likelihood metrics score the probability of generating a token given other words in the sentence29,43. Model-level approaches are advantageous because they offer fine-grained insights into how associations are structurally encoded in a model’s representations. However, they are increasingly difficult to apply to larger models where internal embeddings and probability distributions are not accessible, limiting their effectiveness at evaluating modern LLMs. Output-level methods, on the other hand, are not constrained by this lack of architectural transparency because they rely on LLM outputs generated through prompting rather than internal representations, making them more scalable and broadly applicable. This approach typically involves probing models with prompts that are designed to elicit biased or stereotypical outputs, and then analyzing the generated text44,45. Common strategies include counterfactual testing, where demographic features in prompts are swapped to reveal unequal treatment46,47 and stereotype detection, which probes whether models reproduce or amplify social stereotypes48,49. Other approaches focus on sentiment and toxicity analysis50,51 and acceptance/rejection rates, which measure disparities in decision-like tasks such as hiring or moral dilemmas39,52. Since output-level methods are usually tailored for certain types of biases in specific contexts, they may be better at predicting real-world harm. However, this also makes them inflexible because they do not provide an overall measure of bias, and they cannot be easily extended to other less common forms of bias.”",

Moreover, unlike most output-level metrics that use prompts to evaluate bias in specific contexts, our methodology captures implicit relational knowledge rather than surface-level outputs. One of the main advantages of our methodology is that it is grounded in cognitive psychology and network science. Semantic networks of memory recall patterns have been widely applied to model conceptual memory71, spreading activation72, and semantic priming69 in humans. By operationalizing implicit bias as asymmetries in activation flow across these networks, our approach mirrors established theories of semantic priming65,69 while remaining transparent and human-readable. The networks constructed in this study capture large-scale associative structures. For example, the human network consists of 24,308 nodes and 317,344 edges, while the Llama3 network is even larger with 38,987 nodes and 546,866 edges, reflecting differences in representational richness across agents.”",

In humans, one common way to do this is using free associations1,8,9, which are usually accessed by prompting participants with a cue word and asking them to come up with (typically three) associated responses. Since the task is context neutral, responses represent the associative knowledge of words that we possess at an implicit level. Free associations have been extensively used in cognitive psychology and linguistics for studying lexical retrieval1,4, semantic organization8, and similarity judgments2,10,11. They have also been used for studying differences in cognitive processing between concrete and abstract words, i.e. concreteness effects12. Given that free associations have been shown to correlate with stable implicit attitudes13, they have also been used for studying affective biases9. Investigations of conceptual knowledge using free associations are often conducted within network models of semantic memory built from free associations by connecting cue words to their responses. This results in a complex network structure of human conceptual knowledge in which words get their meanings through relationships to other concepts.”",

        "text": "“While free associations have been widely used for studying semantic memory in humans, very different approaches have been applied for investigating conceptual knowledge in language models. Typically, semantic representations are directly accessed from the model’s embedding space in the form of word embeddings19, i.e. vector representations of words whose meanings are derived from statistical relationships in the training data. Word embeddings provide an advantageous way for investigating certain aspects of semantic memory because of the types of mathematical operations that can be applied within the embedding space. Specifically, the semantic similarity between two words can easily be calculated by computing the cosine similarity between their word vectors. Thus, this approach can be used for extracting word associations directly from the model’s architecture, and these associations can be used to study several aspects related to the model’s conceptual knowledge20,21. In recent years, there has been a great interest in investigating the biases encoded in language models, and measuring the strength of associations between words within the model’s embedding space has been extensively applied for accomplishing this goal22–26. Such an approach follows the same idea that the Implicit Association Test (IAT)27 uses to investigate implicit attitudes in humans. Essentially, it involves using the cosine similarity to measure the strength of the association between pairs of words for assessing biases, for example, man – doctor and woman – nurse. Depending on the strength of these respective associations, this method can reveal certain biases encoded in the model’s embedding space, such as gender biases that reflect the implicit analogy, man is to doctor as woman is to nurse22.”",

        "text": "“Extracting associations from the embedding space for investigating the conceptual knowledge encoded in language models has many advantages, but it also has some important limitations. Perhaps the most significant limitation is that this approach works well for older language models that use static word embeddings – which represent word meanings at the type level – but not so well for newer models, i.e. LLMs, that use contextual word embeddings – which represent word meanings at the token level. Operations on contextual embeddings require that the embeddings are first transformed into static embeddings26, but this can introduce bias and distort similarity estimates19. Another downside to the approach of accessing the embedding space is that it limits the possibility to make comparisons across models and with humans, since the cognitive architecture of each model is vastly different. These limitations have led to a recent shift from the bottom-up approach of accessing the embedding space for investigating the knowledge encoded in language models, towards a top-down approach that involves prompting models with tasks and using their output to make inferences about the knowledge encoded in their embedding space6,7,28. This approach mirrors methods from cognitive psychology that use behavioral experiments to make inferences about the workings of the human mind, and thus it has been aptly named “machine psychology”29. While there are certain limitations that come with prompting LLMs30,31 – for example, outputs may be highly sensitive to variations in prompts and can yield poor results – there are also many advantages to this top-down approach. One advantage is that it can be applied to virtually any LLM, without a deep technical understanding of the model’s embedding space, making it an accessible methodology for researchers from different fields. Another advantage of the machine psychology approach is that it allows for the use of preexisting and well-studied tools, measures, and methodologies that have been applied to humans for years7.”",

We repeated these simulations in each of the four networks. As previously discussed, the spreadr library requires specification of the initial activation level of the activated node(s), and the number of iterations of the spreading activation process. We set the initial activation level of the prime node to the number of nodes in the entire network, and we set the number of iterations to two times the diameter of the network5. We specified that the networks are weighted so the edge weights were taken into consideration. Other parameters of the algorithm, such as the percentage of activation retained by each node, were set to default settings. For each network, the series of spreading activation processes yielded a matrix of final activation levels, such that the columns are all 100 prime nodes while the rows are all nodes of the network. Thus, each column of the matrix gives a vector of final activation levels of all nodes in the network after activating a single prime node, and a single entry in that vector is final activation level of the target node. The matrices were normalized first by normalizing columns of the matrix and then the rows. The normalization is necessary because it accounts for differences in the centrality of nodes within the semantic networks.”",

First, we established that the relationship between semantic alignment and cultural similarity is robust to controls for polysemy (Supplementary Information, section 5.3.3). Second, we examined whether colexification is related to cultural similarity (and geographical proximity) in the same manner that our distributional measure of alignment is.

    "abstract": "Achieving creativity in the real world depends on multiple individual and environmental factors. Among them, divergent thinking (DT) has long been considered a key ingredient of creativity and an essential standard assessment criterion for predicting real-life creative outcomes. However, the link between DT and creative achievement (CA) has yielded heterogeneous results, as outlined by a prior meta-analysis on the DT-CA link published in 2008. Given several limitations of this meta-analysis and the large body of relevant studies that have been published since then, the present paper aimed to offer an updated and methodologically rigorous metaanalytical examination of the DT-CA link. A total of 766 effect sizes from 70 studies encompassing 14,901 subjects were analyzed using a meta-analytic three-level model. The results showed that DT was positively, albeit weakly, linked to CA, with only 3% of shared variance. Moderator analyses indicated that this link was robust to variations in DT and CA measures used, gender, educational level, measurement interval, and country of study, but differed by DT task modality, CA domain, and intellectual giftedness. Specifically, the strength of the DT-CA link was significantly larger for (1) verbal DT tasks, (2) the performance domain of CA, and (4) gifted subjects. A significant interaction effect was also found between CA domain and intellectual giftedness, with the DT-CA link being strongest among gifted subjects in the performance domain. Implications of these results for the study and measurement of creativity are discussed.",

However, this has been examined only through indirect behavioral measures. Here we use network percolation analysis (removal of links in a network whose strength is below an increasing threshold) to computationally examine the robustness of the semantic memory networks of low and high creative individuals. Robustness of a network indicates its flexibility and thus can be used to quantify flexibility of thought as related to creativity. This is based on the assumption that the higher the robustness of the semantic network, the higher its flexibility. Our analysis reveals that the semantic network of high creative individuals is more robust to network percolation compared with the network of low creative individuals and that this higher robustness is related to differences in the structure of the networks. Specifically, we find that this higher robustness is related to stronger links connecting between different components of similar semantic words in the network, which may also help to facilitate spread of activation over their network. Thus, we directly and quantitatively examine the relation between flexibility of thought and creative ability. Our findings support the associative theory of creativity, which posits that high creative ability is related to a flexible structure of semantic memory. Finally, this approach may have further implications, by enabling a quantitative examination of flexibility of thought, in both healthy and clinical populations.",

This theory has spurred several recent studies connecting semantic memory structure and associative thinking to creativity, capitalizing on advances in computational methods. To date, however, this research has almost exclusively focused on assessing creativity in the general population (e.g., assessed via divergent thinking tests), with far less work examining the role of associative thinking in eminently-creative individuals across the arts and sciences. Leveraging data collected as part of the Big-C Project—a sample of world-renowned visual artists and scientists, and an intelligencematched comparison group—we tested whether the ability to generate remote word associations differs as a function of creative expertise. Specifically, we used distributional semantic models to calculate the semantic distance of word associations across three conditions: a free association condition and two goal-directed conditions (common association and uncommon association). We found an interaction between domain expertise and association condition: while artists generated more distant associations overall, this effect was driven by substantially more distant responses in the free association condition. Our findings indicate that visual artists spontaneously produce more remote associations—potentially due to a more interconnected semantic memory network structure—but that creative expertise is less relevant for producing associations that require goal-directed cognitive search.

Phase 1 (free) required participants to respond with the first solution that came to mind (i.e., free association). Participants were specifically instructed to respond as quickly as possible. In contrast to Phase 1, Phases 2 and 3 assessed goal-directed word association. Phase 2 (common) required participants to provide a word that most people would think of. Phase 3 (uncommon) required participants to provide idiosyncratic responses, namely words that were uncommon and relevant to the presented item.”",

Moreover, they also show that such biased recommendations can influence human behaviour in the long term. Humans reproduce the same biases displayed by the AI, even time after the end of their collaboration with the biased system, and in response to novel stimuli. Although this inheritance bias effect could have serious implications, to the best of our knowledge it had not yet been explored in any empirical research. Intending to empirically test the potential effect of the human inheritance of the AI bias, we conducted three experiments. As we had hypothesized, the AI-assisted participants made more errors than the unassisted participants in the classification task, both during the AI-aided and non-aided phases, a result consistently observed over the three experiments. These results are robust: we obtained the same effect in a laboratory experiment conducted under controlled conditions with a sample of university students (Experiment 1) and in two online experiments with an international sample recruited via Prolific Academic (Experiments 2 and 3). Importantly, Experiments 2 and 3 evidence that participants from the AI-assisted group still misclassified, specifically, the 40/60 stimulus in the non-aided phase of the experiment, meaning that their mistakes when performing the classification task by themselves mimicked the bias previously shown by the AI during the first phase. Moreover, we also observed a tendency in the AI-assisted group to categorize the new 50/50 stimuli during the unassisted phase in the same direction as the AI misclassified the 40/60 stimuli during the previous phase. We interpret that participants used the AI biased recommendations as a cue to categorise ambiguous stimuli, which could not be classified according to the classification criteria specified in the instructions. This suggests that participants did not only inherit the AI bias, but also generalized it to novel ambiguous stimuli. In sum, we observed an inheritance effect of the AI biased recommendations from the first phase of the experiment on the participants’ responses during the second phase, where they were no longer supported by the AI. We believe that this is the most interesting and novel result of our present work because it shows an influence of AI bias on human decisions”",

It seems that, the transition from automated to controlled performance was slow, and participants were still heavily influenced by AI bias.

Thus, creative individuals are characterized by “ﬂat” (broader associations) instead of “steep” (few, common associations) associational hierarchies. To study these differences, we implement a novel computational approach to the study of semantic networks, through the analysis of free associations. The core notion of our method is that concepts in the network are related to each other by their association correlations—overlap of similar associative responses (“association clouds”). We began by collecting a large sample of participants who underwent several creativity measurements and used a decision tree approach to divide the sample into low and high creative groups. Next, each group underwent a free association generation paradigm which allowed us to construct and analyze the semantic networks of both groups. Comparison of the semantic memory networks of persons with low creative ability and persons with high creative ability revealed differences between the two networks. The semantic memory network of persons with low creative ability seems to be more rigid, compared to the network of persons with high creative ability, in the sense that it is more spread out and breaks apart into more sub-parts. We discuss how our ﬁndings are in accord and extend Mednick’s (1962) theory and the feasibility of using network science paradigms to investigate high level cognition.",

This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT. We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.",

    "abstract": "Relational structure is important for various cognitive tasks, such as analogical transfer, but its role in learning of new relational concepts is poorly understood. This article reports two experiments testing people’s ability to learn new relational categories as a function of their relational structure. In Experiment 1, each stimulus consisted of 4 objects varying on 2 dimensions. Each category was deﬁned by two binary relations between pairs of objects. The manner in which the relations were linked (i.e., by operating on shared objects) varied between subjects, producing 3 logically different conditions. In Experiment 2, each stimulus consisted of 4 objects varying on 3 dimensions. Categories were deﬁned by three binary relations, leading to six logically different conditions. Various learning models were compared to the behavioral data, based on the theory of schema reﬁnement. The results highlight several shortcomings of schema reﬁnement as a model of relational learning: (1) it can make unreasonable demands on working memory, (2) it does not allow schemas to grow in complexity, and (3) it incorrectly predicts learning is insensitive to relational structure. We propose schema elaboration as an additional mechanism that provides a more complete account, and we relate this mechanism to previous proposals regarding interactions between analogy and representation construction. The current ﬁndings may advance understanding of the cognitive mechanisms involved in learning and representing relational concepts.",

        "text": "“How people learn structured relational concepts is thus a fundamental question for the study of higher-level cognition. However, there is reason to believe the cognitive processes that subserve relational learning are more complex than simply aligning examples to discover their shared structure. For scenarios of even moderate complexity, there is an exponential explosion of possible relations, which moreover can be represented at various levels of abstraction. Finding the right relational representations of both scenarios in an analogy is crucial for analogical reasoning to succeed (Chalmers, French, & Hofstadter, 1992; French, 1997; Mitchell & Hofstadter, 1990). Furthermore, some relational concepts seem intuitively more coherent than others, in that they are easier to learn and use. Conceptual coherence has been argued to arise from higherorder relational constraints that exist both within and between concepts (Murphy & Medin, 1985), but there is still a lack of understanding of what those constraints are or of how they confer coherence.”",

We define relational structure as the manner in which a system of relations is linked together by shared role-fillers (e.g., the object filling role 1 of relation 1 also fills role 1 of relation 2). We elaborate on this definition in Section 1.1 and explain how it is closely related to structure mapping, the dominant psychological theory of analogy (Gentner, 1983). In short, structure mapping is based on the principle of parallel connectivity, according to which two systems are alignable only if their constituent objects and relations are connected in the same way. Thus structure-mapping theory holds that analogy is precisely the process of identifying the shared relational structure between two scenarios (as defined here).”",

Consider the classic solar-system–atom analogy (Gentner, 1983), a subset of which is shown in Fig. 1: Planets revolve around the sun, and planets are smaller than the sun; electrons revolve around the nucleus, and electrons are smaller than the nucleus. The analogy works not only because the same first-order relations are present in both scenarios (i.e., SMALLER THAN and REVOLVES AROUND), but also because these relations share objects in the same way. Specifically, in both scenarios the object that is smaller is also the object doing the revolving, and the object that is larger is also the object being revolved around.”",

Formally, we define the relational structure in (a person’s representation of) a scenario to comprise (1) the set of relations that are present and (2) how those relations are linked together by shared role-fillers. In the example above, there are two linkages between the SMALLER THAN and REVOLVES AROUND relations: one object fills both of their agent roles, and one object fills both of their patient roles. Thus two scenarios have the same relational structure if and only if (a) their relations can be put into correspondence and (b) the role-fillers of those relations can be put into correspondence in a way that preserves role binding (i.e., which object fills each role of each relation). The latter condition is exactly the parallel connectivity constraint. Hence relational structure appears to be a driving force for analogy, and the ability to learn and recognize different relational structures likely plays an important role in the effectiveness of analogical reasoning.”",

First, contrary to the results presented in the experiments below, learning by refinement alone leads to a prediction of no false alarms during learning of a relational category. A false alarm occurs when a stimulus that does not fit the category is mistaken for a category member, because it contains all of the structure present in the subject’s current schema. This can only happen if the schema lacks relational constraints for what constitutes category membership. This is impossible under an idealized model of pure schema refinement, because relations that are present in all category members will never be removed from the schema.”",

That is, it is ambiguous which relation(s) in the stimulus constitute a violation of the category and hence which relational constraints must be added to the schema. Thus schema elaboration is a potentially more flexible mechanism than is schema refinement. This flexibility enables sensitivity to relational structure that is not predicted by schema refinement alone. To implement schema elaboration, we assume that following a false alarm the model identifies all relations that the stimulus violates but that are absent from the schema, and treats each as a candidate to be added. For simplicity, we assume exactly one relation is added to the schema following any false alarm.

Similarly, because people often struggle to recognize surface features as irrelevant information (Cooper & Sweller, 1987), irrelevant objects may place additional strain on working memory, while obscuring the category’s underlying relational structure. Consequently, category structures that contain the greatest numbers of irrelevant objects, such as Condition 3, would be most difficult to learn. This principle is formalized by defining the elaboration score for each candidate relation as the number of its objects (0, 1, or 2) that do not participate in any relations currently in the schema.

For example, upon learning that object A must be bigger than object B, people may be inclined to test whether object B must be brighter than object C. Thus, structures composed of relations that are chained together may be easier to acquire. This principle can be formalized in many ways, but we chose the following approach. For a candidate relation between objects A and B, let R1 be the number of relations already in the schema that operate on A, and let R2 be the number of relations already in the schema that operate on B. Assume A is the object with fewer relations (if there is a difference), so that R1 6 R2. In other words, the candidate relation operates on two objects, one of which already participates in R1 relations in the schema, and the other of which participates in R2 relations. The candidate’s elaboration score is given by the equation in Table 1. Although the equation appears complicated, it simply implements a lexicographic preference for small values of R1 followed by small values of R2 R1. Table 2 shows elaboration scores for different values of R1 and R2. As a special case, the elaboration score when R1 = R2 = 0 was set to zero, to implement a preference not to add isolated relations.

As demonstrated here, schema refinement alone cannot predict sensitivity to relational structure, because the intersection process treats each element of a schema independently.

One possible solution would be to substitute the present all-or-none approach (in which a relation is either in the schema or not) with a continuous learning model, in which continuous-valued strengths are maintained for all possible relations in the schema. Mutual excitation or inhibition between relations could account for sensitivity to relational structure, following principles similar to the ones tested here. For example, the model might assume mutual excitation between any two relations sharing a pair of objects. Such a continuous learning model might generate low performance when its association strengths are weak but still retain some knowledge of the global category structure, thus showing greater structure-sensitivity.”",

This increase of the correlation as compared to Kim’s prior meta-analytic findings could be attributed to the correction of attenuation because a difference between effect sizes prior-Kim vs. post-Kim was non-significant. Different moderators such as scoring methods, instructional settings, intelligence facets, and task modality were tested together with theoretically relevant interactions between some of these factors. These moderation analyses showed that the intelligence–DT relationship can be higher (up to r = .31–.37) when employing test-like assessments coupled with be-creative instructions, and considering DT originality scores. The facet of intelligence (g vs. gf vs. gc) did not affect the correlation between intelligence and DT. Furthermore, we found two significant sample characteristics: (a) average sample age was positively associated with the intelligence–DT correlation, and (b) the intelligence–DT correlation decreased for samples with increasing percentages of females in the samples. Finally, inter-moderator correlations were checked to take potential confounding into account, and also publication bias was assessed. This meta-analysis provides a comprehensive picture of current research and possible research gaps. Theoretical implications, as well as recommendations for future research, are discussed.",

In the context of the standard definition of creativity, responses are considered to be creative if they are novel/original and appropriate/effective (Runco and Jaeger 2012). Following this reasoning, the ability to come up with various ideas (evaluated as being creative) constitutes DT ability as an indicator of creative potential (Runco and Acar 2012). Flexible, critical, and playful thinking, as well as problem-solving ability, and the willingness to accept ambiguous situations are expected to facilitate DT (Karwowski et al. 2016a; Plucker and Esping 2015). In a recent review, Plucker and Esping (2015) outlined various points of view regarding the question of where to locate DT: as a facet of intelligence, as a result of intelligence, or as a separate construct, sharing cognitive abilities with intelligence. A fair number of intelligence researchers consider DT as a subcomponent of intelligence (Carroll 1997; Guilford 1967; Jäger 1982; Karwowski et al. 2016a). (Carroll 1997; see also Chrysikou 2018; Dietrich 2015) stated that DT requires several mental abilities, such as the speed of retrieval (e.g., Forthmann et al. 2019), knowledge (e.g., Weisberg 2006), fluid intelligence (e.g., Beaty et al. 2014; Nusbaum et al. 2014), and motor skills (e.g., the ability to write quickly; see: Forthmann et al. 2017). This view emphasizes that multiple factors might moderate the strength of the association between intelligence and DT. Although DT and intelligence have been seen as somewhat different constructs in the past (Getzels and Jackson 1962; Wallach and Kogan 1965), some researchers have now adopted the view that the constructs might be more similar than previously thought (Silvia 2015). To conclude, a robust empirical examination of the relationship between intelligence and DT is expected to clarify the theoretical relationship of these constructs.”",

In this context, working memory capacity and fluid intelligence are seen as necessary processes when working on DT tasks due to the ability to keep representations active and protect oneself from being distracted (e.g., Beaty et al. 2014; Engle et al. 1999). Fluid intelligence and executive functions are interrelated but not identical. Friedman et al. (2006) found a correlation between executive function updating (the ability to add to and delete information from the working memory) and fluid intelligence. In contrast, there was no correlation between fluid intelligence and executive functions inhibition (the ability to control mental operations) or shifting (the ability to switch between tasks), respectively. Diamond (2013) subsumed cognitive flexibility as part of the family of executive functions, which describe the ability to change perspectives and the ability to “think outside the box”. Flexibility, as assessed by DT tasks (Ionescu 2012) and switching in verbal fluency tasks (Nusbaum and Silvia 2011), can also be considered to reflect cognitive flexibility. Hence, it overlaps with creative thinking, task switching, and set-shifting (Diamond 2013). Diamond (2013) concluded that working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility contribute to higher-order executive functions, namely reasoning, problem-solving, and planning, and that reasoning, as well as problem-solving, are identical with fluid intelligence. Taken together, DT might overlap with both executive functions and fluid intelligence. Benedek et al. (2012) specified that only certain types of intelligence are linked to certain aspects of creative thinking, and provided more differentiated insights into the relationship between these constructs. They found that inhibition, the ability to suppress irrelevant stimuli, was positively related to fluency (number of given responses) and flexibility (number of categories) of idea generation, whereas originality, reflecting the quality of ideas, was predicted by intelligence.”",

Most of the samples comprised of school students (40.50%), followed by university students (34.71%), and adults (15.70%). Other sample types were preschoolers (4.13%) or mixed samples of any of the previously mentioned sample types. The average gender ratio across samples was 0.55 (SD = 0.26) with a range from 0 (only male participants) to 1 (only female participants). The average sample size was 274.68 (SD = 615.28) with sample sizes ranging from N = 10 to N = 5337 participants. Most studies were from the USA (m = 51; UK: m = 12; Germany: m = 9; Austria: m = 8; other countries contributed up to 3 studies: Australia, Canada, Chile, China, France, Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, Korea, Lebanon, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, and United Arab Emirates). The most frequently used DT task was the Alternate Uses Task (33.80% of effect sizes). Next, 30.62% of the effect sizes were based on a DT test battery (e.g., TTCT, ATTA, Wallachand-Kogan, EPoC, BIS, VKT, and so forth). Moreover, 13.66% effect sizes were based on a composite of several DT tasks (i.e., a test battery created in an ad hoc fashion for research purposes). Other DT tasks that were used for 2% to 5% of the effect sizes were Pattern Meanings, Line Meanings, Instances, Similarities, and the Consequences task. The most frequent task modality for DT was verbal (70.20% of effect sizes), 19.55% of the effect sizes were based on figural DT tasks, and only 10.25% of the effect sizes relied on several task modalities. The most frequent intelligence test was one of the variants of the Wechsler test (17.83% of the effect sizes), followed by one of the variants of the IST (9.60%; German: Intelligenzstrukturtest; translates as Intelligence-Structure-Test) and a variant of the Raven’s (7.13%). Many other tests were used to measure intelligence and the interested reader has access to the fully coded data at the OSF repository (https://osf.io/s4hx5). Clearly, the used intelligence measures were far more heterogeneous as compared to the used DT measures. Moreover, task modality was more evenly distributed for intelligence measures with 36.98% of the effect sizes based on verbal, 28.86% based on figural, 27.33% based on several modalities, and 6.83% based on numerical intelligence measures.”",

Hence, we aimed at examining all correlation coefficients available when crossing the moderators: instruction (restricted to be-fluent and be-original/creative instructions) and DT scoring (restricted to fluency and originality/creative quality).

Notably, the usually high correlation between gf and gc (r ≈ .60–.70; e.g., Bryan and Mayer 2020) could preclude finding a differential pattern for these intelligence facets. Hence, it seems that gc, namely knowledge, is required as a basic prerequisite and that gf is required to form and evaluate ideas when participants are explicitly instructed to be creative. In addition, the fact that gc and DT are correlated indicates that knowledge is required for DT, which supports the historical view of Mednick (1962). This knowledge could be used to simply recall relevant solutions (e.g., Miroshnik and Shcherbakova 2019), or provide the conceptual elements to be combined to original ideas. It must not be overlooked that by asking participants to produce many ideas, a DT test resembles verbal fluency tasks (Nusbaum et al. 2014). Beauducel and Kersting’s (2002) view that verbal fluency tasks are markers for gc would have suggested that DT and gc correlate more strongly (as compared to the DT–g or DT–gf correlations) when be-fluent instruction and fluency scoring are used to assess DT.

Be creative instructions are thought to induce more cognitively demanding strategies and thus increase the relevance of intelligence and executive control. In addition, the intelligence–DT correlation was also found to be stronger for the combination of becreative instructions and originality scoring as compared to be-creative instructions and fluency scoring. Clearly, the interaction of instruction and DT outcome has an impact on the relationship between intelligence and DT.

Compared to the test-like settings (or strategy instructions), it seems that under game-like instructions, the relationship between intelligence and DT diminishes. However, it remains unclear to what extent the testing situation influences the relationship between intelligence and DT. Affective/conative factors like current motivation, time pressure, or test anxiety may play a major role when assessing DT. For example, Byron et al. (2010) ran a meta-analysis on the relationship between stressors and creativity and found that when participants expect an evaluation, their creative performance is influenced in an inverted Ushaped manner. Strong evaluative stress or the absence of an evaluation of the performance hinders creative performance, whereas minor levels of evaluative stress support creative performance. Test situations imply the evaluation of the outcome and might be responsible for better performance. Since a considerable part of the participants are students, it can be assumed that they are familiar with test settings and that the expected evaluation of their results may have motivated them to give their best. On the other hand, the evaluative component is absent in a game-like setting and may hinder creative performance. In fact, playing a game does not necessarily stimulate the motivation to perform well. Furthermore, there were no time-constraints for the tasks in the game-like setting. What is more, game-like conditions can also drastically vary from study to study. Thus, not all studies with gamelike conditions rely on the same approach (see Said-Metwaly et al. 2017).”",

As a more general point, it should be noted that common definitions of DT task modality just refer to the content modality of task items and responses, which does not necessarily define the modality of cognitive processes involved in task processing (Benedek and Fink 2019). Especially verbal DT tasks appear to be a quite heterogeneous group, encompassing tasks that require to work creatively with words (e.g., metaphor tasks) or objects (e.g., Alternate Uses Task).

Several studies did not report sufficient information on DT and intelligence tests, which made the coding procedure difficult. As a result, many intelligence tests were coded with g since there was no other information available. Sometimes it remained unclear which instruction was given in DT tests and, more importantly, how DT outcomes were scored. Consequently, coding might have been more detailed if more information had been provided. With regard to DT outcomes, a fully differentiated coding was not possible. All subjective scorings were subsumed under the DT outcome originality. However, the procedures were not similar in all studies. Splitting up subjective scorings into smaller categories might have provided more insight into the different scoring methods (i.e., topscoring, snapshot scoring) that are currently being discussed (Reiter-Palmon et al. 2019). It should further be mentioned that explicit instructions to focus on an aspect of creativity (e.g., “be creative”, “be original”) vary in terms of their exact wording (Acar et al. 2020; Runco et al. 2005). In the current work, we did not further distinguish between these subtleties. The main difference between be-creative and be-original instructions, for example, is the wording and while theoretically “creative” does not mean the same thing as “original”, it is far less clear if participants’ understanding of these words reflects the theoretical understanding of creativity researchers. Hence, it is an open question if these nuances in the instructions lead to a different understanding of the task.”",

Moreover, successful creative problem solving has been associated with the forging of new links between previously unrelated concepts in semantic memory (such as by creating connections between problem and solution concepts), thereby resulting in changes to semantic memory structure67,68. Similarly, episodic simulation involves the flexible recombination of multimodal information to create complex mental simulations (for instance, a soccer player imagining how to execute an upcoming penalty shot).

However, driven by the application of computational network science methodology, the role of semantic memory structure in facilitating individual differences in creative ideation has been increasingly elucidated over the past few years23. Several computational modelling studies have demonstrated how a ‘flexible’ semantic memory network structure — a structure where concepts are closer to each other and more richly connected (that is, a network with lower average shortest path length, lower modularity and higher clustering) — is conducive to higher creative ability24,26,112,192.

The spoken and written language of a society affords a unique way to measure the magnitude and prevalence of these widely shared collective representations. Here, we used word embeddings to systematically quantify gender stereotypes in language corpora that are unprecedented in size (65+ million words) and scope (child and adult conversations, books, movies, TV). Across corpora, gender stereotypes emerged consistently and robustly for both theoretically selected stereotypes (e.g., work–home) and comprehensive lists of more than 600 personality traits and more than 300 occupations. Despite underlying differences across language corpora (e.g., time periods, formats, age groups), results revealed the pervasiveness of gender stereotypes in every corpus. Using gender stereotypes as the focal issue, we unite 19th-century theories of collective representations and 21st-century evidence on implicit social cognition to understand the subtle yet persistent presence of collective representations in language.",

Fourth, to assess the robustness of the results to the choice of word-embedding algorithm, we retrained all word-embedding vectors using the GloVe algorithm (Pennington et al., 2014). In brief, the GloVe algorithm differs from fastText most notably in (a) representing words only as whole words (e.g., the word cat is represented as the whole word cat) rather than also representing words with subword information (e.g., also representing cat as a sum of “ca” and “at,” as in fastText) and (b) working directly on the word–word co-occurrence matrix (for further details, see the glossary in the Supplemental Material). If the results are replicated despite these differences, it indicates that the findings are robust to word-embedding training.”",

Researchers have tracked how ideological leanings influence the ways people process information159. In the early stages, political scientists recognized the untapped potential of NLP methods in harnessing text as an invaluable data source. This led to a substantial integration of computational methods into political analysis160–163, a confluence of disciplines that fostered the emergence of a robust ‘text-as-data’ community within political science160,164. Early work on the inference of policy positions through textual analysis involved a meticulous examination of political texts, focusing on topic detection and the analysis of stylistic elements that shape the political narrative. Resources such as legislative speech165, Senate press releases166 and electoral manifestos167 have been instrumental in these endeavours. With the availability of various political texts, NLP models have enabled automatic classification of ideology in news articles168,169, political speech170,171 and even social media posts162,172 and academic writings173. Currently, various laboratories are pretraining specific language models on political text corpora to enable better ideology identification174,175, together with techniques to make models perform better on unfamiliar text sources176. The inherently metaphor-rich and emotionally charged nature of political rhetoric poses unique challenges for NLP technologies177, necessitating the development of specialized models and approaches178,179. Additionally, there is growing concern regarding the ethics of LLM usage. One example is political microtargeting with LLMs to generate personalized persuasive text163,180. Another aspect is that these models might be limited due to ideological biases present in NLP models’ training data.

We comprehensively examine the psychometric properties of the machine-inferred personality scores, including reliability (internal consistency, split-half, and test–retest), factorial validity, convergent and discriminant validity, and criterion-related validity. Participants were undergraduate students (n = 1,444) enrolled in a large southeastern public university in the United States who completed a self-report Big Five personality measure (IPIP-300) and engaged with an AI chatbot for approximately 20–30 min. In a subsample (n = 407), we obtained participants’ cumulative grade point averages from the University Registrar and had their peers rate their college adjustment. In an additional sample (n = 61), we obtained test–retest data. Results indicated that machine-inferred personality scores (a) had overall acceptable reliability at both the domain and facet levels, (b) yielded a comparable factor structure to self-reported questionnaire-derived personality scores, (c) displayed good convergent validity but relatively poor discriminant validity (averaged convergent correlations = .48 vs. averaged machine-score correlations = .35 in the test sample), (d) showed low criterion-related validity, and (e) exhibited incremental validity over self-reported questionnaire-derived personality scores in some analyses.

However, Cronbach’s α can be estimated at the personality domain level, treating facet scores as “items.” Test-retest reliability, on the other hand, can be readily calculated at both domain and facet levels. We located several empirical studies (e.g., Gow et al., 2016; Harrison et al., 2019; Hickman et al., 2022; Li et al., 2020; Park et al., 2015) reporting reasonable test-retest reliability of machine-inferred personality scores. A third type of reliability index, split-half reliability, cannot be calculated directly, since there is no “item” in machine-inferred personality assessment. However, ML scholars have found a way to overcome this difficulty. Specifically, scholars first randomly split the corpus of text provided by participants into halves with roughly the same number of words or sentences, then apply the trained model to predict personality scores based on the respective segments of words separately. Split-half reliability is calculated as the correlations between these two sets of machine scores with the Spearman-Brown correction. A few studies (e.g., Hoppe et al., 2018; Wang & Chen, 2020; Youyou et al., 2015) reported reasonable split-half reliability of machine-inferred scores with averaged split-half reliability across Big Five domains ranging from .59 to .71.”",

The underlying mechanisms of language, comprising of expressions structured hierarchically and recursively, provide a perspective (in the form of a conceptual structure) on the world, for it is only via language that certain perspectives are available to us and to our thought processes. These mechanisms provide us with a uniquely human way of thinking and talking about the world that is different to the sort of thinking we share with other animals. If the primary function of language were communication then one would expect that the underlying mechanisms of language will be structured in a way that favours successful communication. I show that not only is this not the case, but that the underlying mechanisms of language are in fact structured in a way to maximise computational efficiency, even if it means causing communicative problems. Moreover, I discuss evidence from comparative, neuropathological, developmental, and neuroscientific evidence that supports the claim that language is an instrument of thought.",

That is, to “know English is to know, for example, that the form of words ‘there are cats’ is standardly used to express the thought that there are cats” (cf. also Fodor 1975; 2001; 2008). The rationalist tradition in linguistics was most famously articulated by von Humboldt (2000 [1836]), and in modern times it is most clearly expressed in generative linguistics, a fundamental aspect of which is that natural language is an independent domain of inquiry, subject to its own principles that are distinct of thought but, amongst other uses, expressive of it. It is also expressed in the broader, generative-oriented biolinguistics program, where language is regarded as an internal computational system, a recursive mechanism that produces an infinite set of hierarchically structured expressions that are employed by the conceptual-intentional systems (systems of thought) and the sensorimotor systems to yield language production and comprehension. This particular functional design is strongly shaped by its interface with the systems of thought, rather than by the peripheral process of externalisation inherent in the link with the sensorimotor systems (for an overview of biolinguistics cf., amongst others, Chomsky 2007; Boeckx 2011; Di Sciullo & Boeckx 2011).”",

How does the claim that the function of language is communication fit in with an explanatory theory of language?

This feature of language was noticed by Descartes, who viewed productivity in all domains — language, mathematics, vision, etc. — as deriving from a single source. Modern cognitive science, however, has taken a modular approach, insisting that each domain has its own productivity engine (Brattico & Liikkanen 2009). In order for the underlying mechanisms of language to be able to produce from the set of finite primitive elements an infinite set of expressions they must allow for recursion. For present purposes assume that recursion involves embedding a structural object within another instance of itself — as when a noun phrase is embedded within another noun phrase (cf. Parker 2006; Tomalin 2007; Zwart 2011). The productivity of language means that there is no non-arbitrary limit on the length of a natural language sentence – a sentence (say, S) can always be made longer by embedding it in yet another sentence (“she said that S”), ad infinitum.”",

While the two procedures are similar in that both can yield structural repetition and thus a potential infinite set, they differ in the way in which they do this and thus in the sorts of expressions they can produce. A procedure is recursive if it builds structures by increasing embedding depth, whereas an iterative procedure can only yield flat structures that have no depth of this kind (cf. Karlsson 2010). Recursive procedures can therefore produce linguistic expressions that are, say, centre-embedded, and that lead to long-distance dependencies. Iterative procedures, on the other hand, cannot produce such expressions. In other words, the indefinite repetition or concatenation of elements (iteration) is not the same as the indefinite embedding of elements within other elements of the same type (recursion). Productivity, then, helps explain how we can deal with novel linguistic contexts and how we can produce and understand sentences that we have not previously encountered.”",

And just as sentences are related to each other in a systematic way, thoughts too are related to each other systematically.

We evaluate transformers for estimating psychological well-being from questionnaire text- and descriptive word-responses, and find accuracies converging with rating scales that approach the theoretical upper limits (Pearson\n              r\n               = 0.85,\n              p\n               < 0.001,\n              N\n               = 608; in line with most metrics of rating scale reliability).

For each LIWC category, the total set of 43,993 WUSCT responses was divided into 10 roughly equal samples, each of which was used to test the results of polynomial regression analyses undertaken on the remaining 90% of the data; the results of these cross-validated analyses were then averaged. For 27 of the 81 LIWC categories, a cubic model showed the best fit, for 19, a quadratic model, and for the remaining 35 LIWC categories, the best-fitting model was linear. Then, to further examine the robustness of these linear and nonlinear trends, we used the same method of k-fold cross-validation on each of the constituent samples.”",

The first is a trend towards complexity. Letters per word and the number of words per response both increased with ego development scores, as did individual LIWC categories that were indicative of complexity, such as conjunctions, comparatives and differentiations. Second is a move from egocentrism to a broader social referent, for which the results provided mixed support. In support of this conjecture, the relative frequency of first-person singular pronouns declined with development, as did language focusing on the present, whereas the use of more-detached, impersonal pronouns increased. However, second-person and thirdperson pronouns did not show the concave quadratic trends that might be expected with Loevinger’s proposed sequence. The third trend is the waxing and waning of constraint. The conflict between the self ’s agency on the one hand and the limitations placed on the self by the social group on the other is probably as old as human nature itself. Loevinger’s theory captures the changing features of this dynamic as the person moves from lower to higher stages of ego development. At the earliest (Impulsive) stage in our data, language is essentially solipsistic. At the subsequent Selfprotective stage, terms such as ‘caught’ and ‘obey’ appear, then, at the Conformist stage, ‘lying’ and ‘cheat’, indicating a growing awareness that others exist and that norm violations may bring explicit sanctions. Constraints seem to become more internalized at the next stage (Self-aware), as indexed in references to self-conscious emotions such as embarrassment and shame. Here, terms such as ‘awkward’, ‘embarrassed’ and ‘uncomfortable’ begin to appear. Higher stages suggest greater internalization still and a dampening of concern regarding sanctions for norm violation. Instead, the person may become more concerned with conflicts regarding achievement (Conscientious stage), mutuality (Individualistic stage) and, ultimately, self-actualization (Autonomous/Integrated stages).”",

However, 1 limitation of the current field is the multitude of ways of capturing these narrative features, with little attention to overarching dimensions or latent factors of narrative that are responsible for these associations with well-being. In the present study we uncovered a reliable structure that accommodates commonly studied features of life narratives in a large-scale, multi-university collaborative effort. Across 3 large samples of emerging and midlife adults responding to various narrative prompts (N = 855 participants, N = 2,565 narratives), we found support for 3 factors of life narratives: motivational and affective themes, autobiographical reasoning, and structural aspects. We also identified a “functional” model of these 3 factors that reveals a reduced set of narrative features that adequately captures each factor. Additionally, motivational and affective themes was the factor most reliably related to well-being. Finally, associations with personality traits were variable by narrative prompt. Overall, the present findings provide a comprehensive and robust model for understanding the empirical structure of narrative identity as it relates to well-being, which offers meaningful theoretical contributions to the literature, and facilitates practical decision making for researchers endeavoring to capture and quantify life narratives.

Indeed, we apply the term autobiographical reasoning (Habermas & Bluck, 2000) in the present project because it captures a greater range of constructs including meaning-made, the search for meaning or other reflective processes, and connections between events themselves. However, broadly, the function of this reasoning process is to make sense of the important events of one’s life, establishing personal temporal continuity (Pasupathi et al., 2007). Individuals may approach this meaning-making task in a variety of ways. For example, assimilative approaches weave new experiences into existing narrative plotlines, whereas accommodative approaches require the substantial revision of one’s current self-stories or the creation of new narrative plotlines in order to include new experiences. Further, some events that we experience do not become integrated into our broader sense of self-understanding, and some do; and in order to do that integration, some meaning must be made.”",

An empirical approach to the structure of life narratives would have significant advantages when considered alongside a conceptual approach. At the most fundamental level, an empirical approach provides quantitative evidence for the nature of the narrative structures that emerge. Further, such an approach allows for more complexity in that structure – as narrative qualities like redemption or contamination can be explicitly examined in relation to more than one underlying dimension (i.e., we can see if they ‘load’ on more than one dimension, such as affect and meaning). In short, such advances from an empirical approach allow us to move beyond classifications that reflect the thinking of experts, towards quantitative evidence that informs those classifications and the practice of narrative research.”",

Similarly, themes of growth, which is autobiographical reasoning resulting in positive self-change, is associated with higher well-being (Bauer, McAdams, & Sakeda, 2005; Lilgendahl & McAdams, 2011). In terms of structure, generally more organized, detailed, and elaborated narratives are associated with greater well-being and lesser psychiatric disturbance (e.g., Adler, Chin, Kolisetty, & Oltmanns, 2012; Baerger & McAdams, 1999; Lysaker et al., 2002). However, the degree to which the event is highly negative (e.g., Graci et al., 2018) or more closely identity-related (Waters & Fivush, 2014) also matters. All of these relations to well-being were found in studies using individual coding systems. For example, there are studies examining exploratory processing or accommodative processing or meaning-making in relation to well-being. The only study to date that has examined the underlying factors of multiple narrative features simultaneously in relation to wellbeing was Graci and colleagues (2018). They found that the positive processing factor was related to lower anxiety overall, and that integrative meaning was related to higher perceived”",

In this study of stressful events, the structure factor was related to higher distress levels, which may reflect the idea that there are moderators of the relation between narrative and well-being. For example, a highly organized, structurally sound narrative about a highly stressful event may indicate a high engagement with the experience, which may actually be distressing, or even related to post-traumatic stress disorder (e.g., Boals & Schuettler, 2010), compared to such a narrative about a turning point experience – though such a possibility was not testable without access to narratives from different prompts. Thus, the findings from Graci and colleagues offer us some clues regarding the relation between the dimensions of narrative and well-being, but they are compromised by an examination of a very specific prompt – narratives of highly stressful events, which may or may not generalize to a broad array of life narrative prompts.”",

And, in examining the associations between narrative identity and well-being in a longitudinal sample, Adler and colleagues (2015) found that individual differences in agency, redemption, and contamination in low point and health challenge scenes, but not in high point scenes, were associated with different trajectories of well-being over the subsequent four years. Thus, researchers should consider the prompts of collected narratives in thinking about how best to capture the patterns of narration relevant to the topic of study, and what the associations between narrative features and other variables might mean (see also Galliher, McLean, & Syed, 2017 for a similar discussion of narrative content).”",

Individuals do not often engage in effortful reflection and meaning-making about trips to the grocery store. Part of the differences in these kinds of stories is due to methods, as small stories are often collected in conversational contexts, which pull for different kinds of stories.

The ubiquity of language data, alongside extremely rapid methodological innovations, has magnetized the field, attracting researchers with the promise of measuring, forecasting, and understanding the most central questions in business, psychology, biology, sociology, the humanities, and beyond. The power of language analysis to reveal insights into human thought, feeling, and behavior has become a core interest emerging from recent technological advances, which are being probed to unearth deeply embedded truths about the human condition. However, NLP research has reached a critical juncture, sitting at the cusp of societal transformation in many aspects of daily life. The details of how NLP research develops over the next 3–5 years will define this transformation. In this emerging, near-infinite space of NLP-driven research, we provide a critical frame of reference for how, when, and why these technologies should evolve in a particularly transdisciplinary manner. Specifically, we discuss (a) the urgency of pairing existing and emerging NLP research with existing scientific knowledge, theory, and principles from the behavioral sciences; (b) the coevolution of NLP technologies; and (c) the practical implications and ethical consequences of expanding language analysis using broader psychosocial theories of the human condition. While our discussion focuses principally on using language as a window in the individual mind, this topic holds substantial implications for other disciplines and lines of inquiry, including the dynamics of social interaction and beyond.

The words–attention connection is a dominant one in NLP, in part, because it is a unifying idea in language scholarship—it is not merely limited to NLP in the social sciences. In the cognitive sciences, for example, it is widely acknowledged that attention plays a fundamental role in language itself (Mishra, 2015). In the social sciences, it is well understood that when people use language, they are conveying what they are attending to—objects, events, and ideas—and thus directing others’ attention to the same things they are focused on (Bruner, 1974; Millikan, 1987; Salley & Colombo, 2016).”",

The entirety of an organism’s activity can be understood as a confluence of multiple, interconnected streams of behavior that interact with a massive number of cognitive, emotional, social, and environmental factors. Verbal behavior, whether spoken or written, reflects and responds to all of these factors to some degree.

However, NLP research in the social sciences often examines individuals in isolation, ignoring the powerful role of the situation in shaping psychological processes.

For example, one of the most wellestablished findings in the psychology of language research is that self-referential pronouns (first-person singular pronouns or “I-words”) tend to be reliably and positively correlated with the psychological state of depression (Edwards & Holtzman, 2017; Rude et al., 2004; Zimmermann et al., 2017). Despite the generally high replicability of this finding, the dominant words-as-attention framework does not provide a clear account for why, when, or how depression and self-focus are related to each other. That is, this framework suggests only that depressed people tend to focus more on the self than nondepressed people, requiring additional theory to explain why attention may operate this way in the context of depression.

Rather than examining a single person’s language output, discourse analysis explores the interplay of multiple voices within a given social setting. The key distinction lies in approaching discourse as a construct that extends beyond individual psychology or situational factors. It encompasses the collective construction of meaning, power dynamics, and the negotiation of shared understanding within a group (Van Dijk, 2015). Discourse analysis, often rooted in linguistic and sociological theories, seeks to unveil patterns, structures, and social phenomena emerging from conversational exchanges.

In this task, participants are presented with a prime (stimulus) word (e.g., cat) immediately followed by either a related (e.g., dog) or an unrelated (e.g., truck) target word. A speeded response is expected on the target word (e.g., a lexical-decision, i.e., is it a word or not?) and a response time is recorded. Semantic priming refers to the finding that people respond faster to target words preceded by related, relative to unrelated, primes. This behavioral index therefore provides information about the influence of a semantic context (i.e., the prime word) on the processing of the target word and is suitable for the development of theories of semantic memory.”",

The naming task consists in reading aloud the target, while the lexical decision task consists in pressing one of two buttons to specify if the target is a valid word or not. Aside from the relatedness between the prime and the target, the item data is also available for stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) between the prime and target items of 200 and 1,200 ms.

    "abstract": "Several theories posit that creative people are able to generate more divergent ideas. If this is correct, simply naming unrelated words and then measuring the semantic distance between them could serve as an objective measure of divergent thinking. To test this hypothesis, we asked 8,914 participants to name 10 words that are as different from each other as possible. A computational algorithm then estimated the average semantic distance between the words; related words (e.g., cat and dog) have shorter distances than unrelated ones (e.g., cat and thimble). We predicted that people producing greater semantic distances would also score higher on traditional creativity measures. In Study 1, we found moderate to strong correlations between semantic distance and two widely used creativity measures (the Alternative Uses Task and the Bridge-the-Associative-Gap Task). In Study 2, with participants from 98 countries, semantic distances varied only slightly by basic demographic variables. There was also a positive correlation between semantic distance and performance on a range of problems known to predict creativity. Overall, semantic distance correlated at least as strongly with established creativity measures as those measures did with each other. Naming unrelated words in what we call the Divergent Association Task can thus serve as a brief, reliable, and objective measure of divergent thinking.",

Compared with manually scored tasks, the DAT scoring is automatic and objective, allowing researchers to collect large samples with little effort and no rater bias. Further, the scoring is absolute and not sample dependent, making it conducive to comparing diverse populations. The DAT may also reduce some biases seen in other tests of divergent thinking. Experiential bias occurs when one’s past experience influences the diversity of responses (45). When listing uses of a brick in the Alternative Uses Task, for example, a brick layer may provide different responses than a lawyer, leading to more uncontrollable variation. Similarly, different object prompts in the Alternative Uses Task can lead to different responses with varying reliability between computational scoring and manually scored responses (27). The DAT avoids these issues by giving an open-ended prompt and using a model trained on an international corpus (i.e., global website data). Relatedly, fluency contamination occurs when high fluency can artificially inflate originality scores; the more responses that participants list, the more likely some of them will be unique (22). The DAT avoids this issue by requiring all participants to generate the same number of responses.”",

Naming unrelated words measures originality with better face validity than appropriateness, although both are important components of creativity (31). DAT scores may thus partly reflect other constructs more related to divergence than creativity, such as overinclusive thinking or schizotypy (46). Still, the DAT scores correlated with assessments of appropriateness on the Bridge-the-AssociativeGap Task. Another limitation is that participants may artificially modulate their scores using different strategies to generate the words. Intentionally choosing rare words, looking around the room for inspiration, and following letter-based strategies (e.g., choosing rhyming words) can all influence the overall score. The fairly short time limit of 4 min may reduce the likelihood that participants will consider and implement these various strategies. Beyond the task itself, a limitation of our study is the small number of measures used. Given the high correlation between originality and flexibility in the Alternative Uses Task scores and the low number of items in the problem-solving tasks, future studies could replicate our results using other scoring methods as well as longer and more diverse creativity measures.”",

First, in contrast to gold standards such as WordSim-353 and MEN, it explicitly quantifies similarity rather than association or relatedness so that pairs of entities that are associated but not actually similar (Freud, psychology) have a low rating. We show that, via this focus on similarity, SimLex-999 incentivizes the development of models with a different, and arguably wider, range of applications than those which reflect conceptual association. Second, SimLex-999 contains a range of concrete and abstract adjective, noun, and verb pairs, together with an independent rating of concreteness and (free) association strength for each pair. This diversity enables fine-grained analyses of the performance of models on concepts of different types, and consequently greater insight into how architectures can be improved. Further, unlike existing gold standard evaluations, for which automatic approaches have reached or surpassed the inter-annotator agreement ceiling, state-of-the-art models perform well below this ceiling on SimLex-999. There is therefore plenty of scope for SimLex-999 to quantify future improvements to distributional semantic models, guiding the development of the next generation of representation-learning architectures.",
